  {"id":"ajzen1991","abstract":"Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ajzen","given":"Icek"}],"collection-title":"Theories of Cognitive Self-Regulation","container-title":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","container-title-short":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","DOI":"10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T","ISSN":"0749-5978","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1991,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"179-211","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The theory of planned behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/074959789190020T","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"allen2017","abstract":"Defined as sexually explicit material that elicits erotic thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, internet pornography is a prevalent form of media that may facilitate problematic use and craving for engagement. Research suggests that superordinate cognitions and information processing, such as desire thinking and metacognition, are central to the activation and escalation of craving in addictive behaviours. The current study aimed to contribute to the literature by testing the proposed metacognitive model of desire thinking and craving in a sample of problematic pornography users, while revising the model by incorporating negative affect. From a theoretical perspective, environmental cues trigger positive metacognitions about desire thinking that directly influence desire thinking, resulting in the escalation of craving, negative metacognitions, and negative affect. Participants were recruited via an online survey and screened for problematic internet pornography use. Path analyses were used to investigate relationships among the aforementioned constructs in a final sample of 191 participants. Consistent with previous research, results of this study validated the existence of metacognitive processes in the activation of desire thinking and escalation of craving, while indicating that desire thinking has the potential to influence negative affect. Additionally, results supported the role of significant indirect relationships between constructs within the revised model of metacognition, desire thinking, and psychopathology. Collectively, the findings demonstrate the clinical value of a metacognitive conceptualisation of problematic pornography use. Exploring the metacognitive mechanisms that underpin problematic internet pornography use may give rise to the development of new treatment and relapse prevention strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kannis-Dymand","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Katsikitis","given":"Mary"}],"container-title":"Addictive Behaviors","container-title-short":"Addictive Behaviors","DOI":"10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.02.001","ISSN":"0306-4603","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"65-71","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Problematic internet pornography use: the role of craving, desire thinking, and metacognition","title-short":"Problematic internet pornography use","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460317300655","volume":"70"},
  {"id":"amit2012","abstract":"We conducted three experiments indicating that characteristically deontological judgments—here, disapproving of sacrificing one person for the greater good of others—are preferentially supported by visual imagery. Experiment 1 used two matched working memory tasks—one visual, one verbal—to identify individuals with relatively visual cognitive styles and individuals with relatively verbal cognitive styles. Individuals with more visual cognitive styles made more deontological judgments. Experiment 2 showed that visual interference, relative to verbal interference and no interference, decreases deontological judgment. Experiment 3 indicated that these effects are due to people’s tendency to visualize the harmful means (sacrificing one person) more than the beneficial end (saving others). These results suggest a specific role for visual imagery in moral judgment: When people consider sacrificing someone as a means to an end, visual imagery preferentially supports the judgment that the ends do not justify the means. These results suggest an integration of the dual-process theory of moral judgment with construal-level theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Amit","given":"Elinor"},{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797611434965","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8]]},"language":"en","page":"861-868","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"You see, the ends don’t justify the means: visual imagery and moral judgment","title-short":"You see, the ends don’t justify the means","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611434965","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"andersen1994a","abstract":"Sexual self-schemas are cognitive generalizations about sexual aspects of oneself. In Part 1, a measure of men's sexual self-schema is developed. Studies of test—retest and internal consistency reliability and validity studies of factor analysis, internal structure, convergent and discriminant validity, process, group difference, and change are provided. The construct consists of 3 dimensions: passionate—loving, powerful-aggressive, and open-minded-liberal traits. In Part 2, the data suggest that men's sexual schema is derived from past sexual experience, is manifest in current sexual experience, and guides future sexual behavior. In Part 3, the data document the cognitive processing aspects of sexual schema. Consistent with the investigators' schema research with women, these data substantiate the importance of cognitive representations of sexuality. Historically, research on male sexuality has focused on the assessment of men's sexual behaviors, sexual responses, and related sexual affects or attitudes. In contrast, little research has explored men's sexuality as a social-cognitive phenomenon or attempted to map men's cognitive views of the sexual self. Andersen and Cyranowski (1994) offered the concept of sexual self-schema as an aspect of one's self-view that is specific to sexuality and operationalized this construct with respect to women's sexuality. Conceptually, men should also possess sexual selfschemas; however, the content of men's sexual self-views was expected to differ from that obtained with women. Here we outline the conceptual framework for men's sexual self-schema and detail the psychometric properties of a scale to measure a man's sexual self-schema. First, however, we offer a brief overview of the common approaches to male sexual assessment. Second, we outline the conceptual and methodological advantages of the sexual self-schema approach, and third, we highlight the literature related to the gender differences that were expected to emerge in the content of men's (vs. women's) sexual self-views.","author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Barbara L."},{"family":"Cyranowski","given":"Jill M."},{"family":"Espindle","given":"Derek"}],"DOI":"10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1079","issued":{"date-parts":[[1994]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Women's sexual self-schema.","type":"paper-conference"},

Major domain-limited theories of aggression include cognitive neoassociation, social learning, social interaction, script, and excitation transfer theories. Using the general aggression model (GAM), this review posits cognition, affect, and arousal to mediate the effects of situational and personological variables on aggression. The review also organizes recent theories of the development and persistence of aggressive personality. Personality is conceptualized as a set of stable knowledge structures that individuals use to interpret events in their social world and to guide their behavior. In addition to organizing what is already known about human aggression, this review, using the GAM framework, also serves the heuristic function of suggesting what research is needed to fill in theoretical gaps and can be used to create and test interventions for reducing aggression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Bushman","given":"Brad J."}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Psychology","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"page":"27-51","PMID":"11752478","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Human aggression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135231","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"anderson2012","abstract":"Scholars who examine the psychological effects of power have often argued that possessing power shapes individual behavior because it instills an elevated sense of power. However, little is known about the personal sense of power because very few studies have examined it empirically. In studies involving a total of 1,141 participants and nine different samples, we found that the personal sense of power was coherent within social contexts; for example, individuals who believed that they can get their way in a group also believed that they can influence fellow group members’ attitudes and opinions. The personal sense of power was also moderately consistent across relationships but showed considerable relationship specificity; for example, individuals’ personal sense of power vis-à-vis their friend tended to be distinct but moderately related to their personal sense of power vis-à-vis their parent. And the personal sense of power was affected not only by sociostructural factors (e.g., social position, status) but also by personality variables such as dominance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"John","given":"Oliver P."},{"family":"Keltner","given":"Dacher"}],"container-title":"Journal of Personality","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00734.x","ISSN":"1467-6494","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","page":"313-344","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The personal sense of power","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2011.00734.x","volume":"80"},
  {"id":"antai2011","abstract":"Background: Controlling behavior is more common and can be equally or more threatening than physical or sexual violence. This study sought to determine the role of husband/partner controlling behavior and power relations within intimate relationships in the lifetime risk of physical and sexual violence in Nigeria.\nMethods: This study used secondary data from a cross-sectional nationally-representative survey collected by faceto-face interviews from women aged 15 - 49 years in the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. Utilizing a stratified two-stage cluster sample design, data was collected frrm 19 216 eligible with the DHS domestic violence module, which is based on the Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the role of husband/partner controlling behavior in the risk of ever experiencing physical and sexual violence among 2877 women aged 15 - 49 years who were currently or formerly married or cohabiting with a male partner.\nResults: Women who reported controlling behavior by husband/partner had a higher likelihood of experiencing physical violence (RR = 3.04; 95% CI: 2.50 - 3.69), and women resident in rural areas and working in low status occupations had increased likelihood of experiencing physical IPV. Controlling behavior by husband/partner was associated with higher likelihood of experiencing physical violence (RR = 4.01; 95% CI: 2.54 - 6.34). In addition, women who justified wife beating and earned more than their husband/partner were at higher likelihood of experiencing physical and sexual violence. In contrast, women who had decision-making autonomy had lower likelihood of experiencing physical and sexual violence.\nConclusion: Controlling behavior by husband/partner significantly increases the likelihood of physical and sexual IPV, thus acting as a precursor to violence. Findings emphasize the need to adopt a proactive integrated approach to controlling behavior and intimate partner violence within the society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Antai","given":"Diddy"}],"container-title":"BMC Public Health","container-title-short":"BMC Public Health","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2458-11-511","ISSN":"1471-2458","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,12]]},"language":"en","page":"511","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Controlling behavior, power relations within intimate relationships and intimate partner physical and sexual violence against women in nigeria","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-511","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"barkow1975","abstract":"Examination of human prestige-striving in phylogenetic perspective suggests it to be essentially homologous with primate social dominance. In our own species, however, selection for \"cultural capacity\" has transformed striving for social dominance into striving to evaluate the self as being higher in rank than others or, in other words, into striving for self-esteem. We maintain self-esteem through symbolic means, usually referred to as seeking \"prestige.\" We also utilize various distortions of perception and cognition to this end, including rationalization, identification, and change of reference group. Prestige strategies may emphasize attaining prestige through being part of a prestigious group or may be more individualistically oriented. They may also stress receipt of the approbation of internal representations of absent or imaginary others or emphasize the respect of those physically present. Traditional societies provide culturally patterned strategies which tend to perpetuate these societies. Thus, success in the hunt brings prestige among hunting peoples, large herds among pastoralists, etc. Culturally constituted rationalizations help to maintain the self-esteem of those who fail. Culture contact is one of the chief causes of the failure of prestige-allocation systems, the very existence of wealthy and powerful newcomers devaluing the coin of the prestige obtainable through traditional strategies. Newly development prestige strategies are likely to have deleterious long-term effects on social stability. The so-called need for achievement reveals itself to be a particular type of prestige strategy, one emphasizing entrepreneurial tactics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Barkow","given":"Jerome H."},{"family":"Akiwowo","given":"Akinsola A."},{"family":"Barua","given":"Tushar K."},{"family":"Chance","given":"M.

  {"id":"barnett2013","abstract":"Most empathy research in the forensic context has assumed that empathy has two components. In this two-component model, the cognitive component involves perspective taking, and the affective component involves experiencing appropriate emotion. In this review, we identify how this assumption has both dominated and limited empathy research with offenders, nearly all of which has been conducted with sexual offenders. We propose instead that five components are involved in the experience of empathy: perspective taking, the ability to experience emotion, a belief that others are worthy of compassion and respect, situational factors, and an ability to manage personal distress. We suggest that the non-situational factors that blocked empathy for the victim at the time of a sexual offense are probably other dispositions known to be related to sexual offending, such as sexual preoccupation, generalized hostility to others, implicit theories about children and sex, and/or poor coping with negative emotions. We conclude with directions for practice and research, and urge greater caution in correctional policies on victim empathy programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnett","given":"Georgia D."},{"family":"Mann","given":"Ruth E."}],"container-title":"Trauma, Violence, & Abuse","container-title-short":"Trauma, Violence, & Abuse","DOI":"10.1177/1524838012467857","ISSN":"1524-8380","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"22-33","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Cognition, empathy, and sexual offending","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838012467857","volume":"14"},

Social label and certification organizations can expand the scope of self-regulation but not beyond that with unconditional altruism.

  {"id":"barron2020","abstract":"Human same-sex sexual attraction (SSSA) has long been considered to be an evolutionary puzzle. The trait is clearly biological: it is widespread and has a strong additive genetic basis, but how SSSA has evolved remains a subject of debate. Of itself, homosexual sexual behaviour will not yield offspring, and consequently individuals expressing strong SSSA that are mostly or exclusively homosexual are presumed to have lower fitness and reproductive success. How then did the trait evolve, and how is it maintained in populations? Here we develop a novel argument for the evolution of SSSA that focuses on the likely adaptive social consequences of SSSA. We argue that same sex sexual attraction evolved as just one of a suite of traits responding to strong selection for ease of social integration or prosocial behaviour. A strong driver of recent human behavioural evolution has been selection for reduced reactive aggression, increased social affiliation, social communication and ease of social integration. In many prosocial mammals sex has adopted new social functions in contexts of social bonding, social reinforcement, appeasement and play. We argue that for humans the social functions and benefits of sex apply to same-sex sexual behaviour as well as heterosexual behaviour. As a consequently we propose a degree of SSSA, was selected for in recent human evolution for its non-conceptive social benefits. We discuss how this hypothesis provides a better explanation for human sexual attractions and behaviour than theories that invoke sexual inversion or single-locus genetic models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Barron","given":"Andrew B."},{"family":"Hare","given":"Brian"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

We examine this self-dehumanization effect across four studies. Studies 1 and 2 show that when participants are perpetrators of social ostracism, they view themselves as less human compared with when they engage in nonaversive interpersonal interactions. Perceived immorality of their behavior mediated this effect. Studies 3 and 4 highlight the behavioral consequences of self-dehumanization. The extent to which participants saw themselves as less human after perpetrating social ostracism predicted subsequent prosocial behavior. Studies 2 to 4 also demonstrate that consequences of self-dehumanization occur independently of any effects of self-esteem or mood. The findings are discussed in relation to previous work on dehumanization and self-perception.

  {"id":"basu2010","abstract":"Much of economics is built on the assumption that individuals are driven by self-interest and economic development is an outcome of the free play of such individuals. On the few occasions that the existence of altruism is recognized in economics, the tendency is to build this from the axiom of individual selfishness. The aim of this paper is to break from this tradition and to treat as a primitive that individuals are endowed with the 'cooperative spirit', which allows them to work in their collective interest, even when that may not be in their self-interest. The paper tracks the interface between altruism and group identity. By using the basic structure of a Prisoner's Dilemma game among randomly picked individuals and building into it assumptions of general or in-group altruism, the paper demonstrates how our selfish rationality interacts with our innate sense of cooperation.

In this paper, we study how the formation of other-regarding preferences during childhood is related to parental background. Our subjects, aged 4–12 years, are classified into other-regarding types based on simple binary-choice dictator games. The main finding is that the children of parents with low education are less altruistic, more selfish, and more likely to be weakly spiteful. This link is robust to controlling for a rich set of children’s characteristics and class fixed effects. It also stands out against the overall development of preferences, as we find children to become more altruistic, less selfish, and less likely to be weakly spiteful with increasing age. The results, supported by a complementary analysis of World Values Survey data, suggest an important role of socialization in the formation of other-regarding preferences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Chytilová","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Pertold-Gebicka","given":"Barbara"}],"container-title":"Experimental Economics","container-title-short":"Exp Econ","DOI":"10.1007/s10683-013-9355-y","ISSN":"1573-6938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"24-46","source":"Springer Link","title":"Parental background and other-regarding preferences in children","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10683-013-9355-y","volume":"17"},

We are concerned that studies of sacrificial dilemmas may lack experimental, mundane, and psychological realism and therefore suffer from low external validity. Our apprehensions stem from three observations about trolley problems and other similar sacrificial dilemmas: (i) they are amusing rather than sobering, (ii) they are unrealistic and unrepresentative of the moral situations people encounter in the real world, and (iii) they do not elicit the same psychological processes as other moral situations.

Religious and philosophical traditions in India stress its role in emancipating the ego and providing an understanding for one’s perspective as contrasted against the magnanimity of the Almighty, the Supernatural or the Universe. Most academicians within the scientific psychological realm also look upon humility as a virtue. Accredited as a powerful tool for personal, social and organisational well-being, humility, as a moral construct, deserves a thorough and detailed exploration to reveal what it entails, what its corollaries are and how it can be measured. It is particularly useful in Indian context, as indigenous traditions have always emphasised humility. However, such efforts have remained relatively neglected till recent years. Of course, a few researchers with emphasis on moral and positive psychology have probed and prodded this concept to lay bare its comprising elements and to build tools to measure it. These attempts have been discussed here. Information was culled from surveying the scientific literature of the past four decades from psychological and philosophical journals and handbooks. Its overlap with Indian concept of humility has been discussed, and the unresolved questions about its nuances are put forward for future research endeavour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhattacharya","given":"Oindrila"},{"family":"Chatterjee","given":"Amita"},{"family":"Basu","given":"Jayanti"}],"container-title":"Psychological Studies","container-title-short":"Psychol Stud","DOI":"10.1007/s12646-017-0387-9","ISSN":"0974-9861","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"Springer Link","title":"Humility: an emerging construct in moral psychology","title-short":"Humility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12646-017-0387-9","volume":"62"},

Blair (1993) has suggested that humans possess a functionally similar mechanism which mediates the suppression of aggression in the context of distress cues. He has suggested that this mechanism is a prerequisite for the development of the moral/conventional distinction; the consistently observed distinction in subject's judgments between moral and conventional transgressions. Psychopaths may lack this violence inhibitor. A causal model is developed showing how the lack of this mechanism would explain the core behavioural symptoms associated with the psychopathic disorder. A prediction of such a causal model would be that psychopaths should fail to make the moral/conventional distinction. This prediction was confirmed.

They also wrote essays justifying their ratings. Overall and in support of previous research, older adults were more likely than younger adults to attribute the cause of the negative outcome to the primary character (Blanchard-Fields, 1994). This bias was not attenuated by the age-relevance factor. Instead, in the work context, older and middle-aged adults placed greater blame on main characters relevant to their age group for negative outcomes than did young adults. However, older adults were also more likely than middle-aged or young adults to attribute the cause of a negative outcome to situational factors. Age relevance and context influenced attributional ratings for all participants in that: (a) older characters were rated higher on external attributions and younger characters were rated higher on internal attributions; and (b) higher internal attributions were made for work situations than for family situations. Finally, young and middle-aged adults were more dialectical in justifying their causal attributions than older adults.

However, little conceptual thinking has been done about the relations between moral cognition and moral action. As a result, empirical research in this area has been unsystematic and difficult to interpret. A theoretical model, the Self Model, is proposed here, starting from the assumption that moral reasons are functionally related to action. First, a concept of cognitive motivation is presented as necessary for any cognitive account of morality. Two cognitive approaches to moral conduct, Piaget's and Haan's, are then discussed in their positive contributions and in their limitations. The Self Model is finally described through a set of empirically testable propositions. Its major theoretical characteristics are: it is cognitive, recognizing as the central function of human cognition the appraisal of truth; it acknowledges a basic duality of motivation, but stresses the normative pull of cognitive motivation; it is developmental; it uses the self as the central explanatory concept, establishing both the sense of personal responsibility and the dynamism of self-consistency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Blasi","given":"Augusto"}],"container-title":"Developmental Review","container-title-short":"Developmental Review","DOI":"10.1016/0273-2297(83)90029-1","ISSN":"0273-2297","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1983,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"178-210","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Moral cognition and moral action: A theoretical perspective","title-short":"Moral cognition and moral action","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0273229783900291","volume":"3"},

Without understanding it, we risk everything and without capitalising on it, we gain nothing. This accessible book from Glynis M.

Featuring chapters on all the major issues in the psychology of risk including risk assessment, hazard perception, decision-making, risk and crisis management, risk and emotion, risk communication, safety cultures, the social amplification and social representation of risk and mechanisms for changing risk responses, Breakwell uses illustrations and examples to bring to life the significance of her research findings.

  {"id":"bright2006","abstract":"Judges assume that gruesome evidence can influence juror verdicts, but little is known about the manner in which the influence is manifested. In a 2 x 3 study that varied the gruesome content of photographic and verbal evidence, gruesome verbal evidence did not influence mock juror emotional states, and had no impact on the conviction rate. Mock jurors who saw gruesome photographs, compared with those who saw no photographs, reported experiencing significantly more intense emotional responses, including greater anger at the defendant. The conviction rate when visual evidence in the form of gruesome or neutral photographs was included was significantly higher than the conviction rate without photographic evidence. Mean ratings of the inculpatory weight of prosecution evidence by mock jurors presented with gruesome photographs were significantly higher than those by mock jurors who did not view any photographs. Further analyses revealed that mock juror anger toward the defendant mediated the influence of the gruesome photographs in enhancing the weight of inculpatory evidence.","author":[{"family":"Bright","given":"David A."},{"family":"Goodman-Delahunty","given":"Jane"}],"container-title":"Law and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Law Hum Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s10979-006-9027-y","ISSN":"0147-7307","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"183-202","PMID":"16786406","source":"PubMed","title":"Gruesome evidence and emotion: anger, blame, and jury decision-making","title-short":"Gruesome evidence and emotion","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

Research has shown that spiteful preferences play a crucial role in the development of human large-scale cooperation. However, there is little evidence of the factors explaining spiteful behavior in children. We investigate the relationship between children’s cognitive skills and spiteful behavior in a sample of 214 preschoolers aged 5–6 and their mothers. Here, other-regarding behavior in children is elicited through four simple allocation decisions. A key advantage of our study is that we have information about children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills as well as maternal and household characteristics. We find that higher cognitive skills are associated with more spiteful behavior in children. This relationship is even more pronounced among boys. Moreover, we find further gender differences that depend on the measure of cognitive skills and the degree of spite displayed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bügelmayer","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Katharina Spiess","given":"C."}],"container-title":"Journal of Economic Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.joep.2014.10.001","ISSN":"0167-4870","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"154-167","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Spite and cognitive skills in preschoolers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487014000786","volume":"45"},

Bandura's Social Cognition theory is offered as a possible explanation for sexual aggression by children. Two theory-based hypothesis are tested. First, are sexually aggressive children cognitively deficient when compared to the other groups? Second, do the sexually aggressive children have cognitive distortions about their behavior and about sex? Similarities were found in the aggressive and sexually aggressive groups on several measures. Physically aggressive boys were found to have some sexual behavior problems. Sexually aggressive boys were also found to be physically aggressive. Physically aggressive boys were found to have the least severe and least frequent victimization history.

Social psychologists were attracted to this area by the revolutionary societal changes in attitudinal permissiveness and in actual behavior, by the research initiated by the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, and by a pressing applied interest in solving the problems of unwanted and unneeded conception. Sex research is of special value to our field because it has built-in experimental impact, its technology includes the direct nonverbal assessment of a motivational-emotional state, and it is of obvious relevance to innumerable real- life issues. Upon examination, many of the traditional principles and research paradigms of social-personality psychologists may be perceived as being directly relevant to an understanding of sexuality. A tentative model of a social psychological approach to this research domain (the Sexual Behavior Sequence) is presented.

More precisely, it examines the conditions for the initiation and engagement of cooperative agreements between two types of economic agents: (i) those with a standard rationality (maximization of own payoffs); and (ii) those with a preference for cooperative behaviour (after contract initiation). Each agent knows his own \"type\" but is ignorant of the \"type\" of his partner in the game. However the proportion of the two types of players in the population is common knowledge. This analysis concerns a non-repeated game under incomplete information without the possibility of eliminating opportunism through contracts. We show that higher the proportion of \"rational\" individuals in the population, higher the incentives for these players to cooperate. A minimum of \"rational' agents is necessary to induce cooperation from this population group. The degree of cooperation in the entire population is however independent of the initial proportion of \"rational\" agents being dictated by the payoff configurations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Cabon-Dhersin","given":"Marie-Laure"},{"family":"Ramani","given":"Shyama V."}],"container-title":"Revue d'Économie Politique; Paris","ISSN":"03732630","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"Mar/Apr 2007"},"language":"French","page":"271-284","source":"ProQuest","title":"La rationalité des agents économiques va-t-elle toujours à l'encontre de la coopération ?

The results show that there is a high correlation between RMA and hostile sexism, benevolent sexism, culture of honour, and right-wing authoritarianism. Hostile sexism and right-wing authoritarianism predict RMA in both male and female samples. Benevolent sexism predicts RMA in the female sample. In addition, in the male sample right-wing authoritarianism interacts with hostile sexism to predict RMA, while in the female sample right-wing authoritarianism interacts with benevolent sexism to predict RMA.

We administered to 21 sexual offenders and to 21 nonoffenders two classical first- and second-order ToM tasks, a selection of six Strange Stories, and a semi-structured interview, the Theory of Mind Assessment Scale (Th.o.m.a.s), which provides a multi-dimensional evaluation of ToM, investigating first- vs. third-person and egocentric vs. allocentric perspectives. Results show that sexual offenders performed worse than controls on second-order ToM tasks, on Strange Stories and on each of the Th.o.m.a.s dimensions, whereas they did as well as the control group on first-order ToM tasks. A detailed analysis of participants’ performance on Th.o.m.a.s. showed that sex offenders performed worse on the third-person than on the first-person ToM scale, and worse on the allocentric than on the egocentric perspective; these findings did not apply to the controls.

  {"id":"castillo2010","abstract":"We investigate the motives behind reciprocal behavior by making selfish acts anonymous and not common knowledge. In one treatment, subjects were assigned to the role of proposer or responder and played a trust game with random matching for 20 rounds. In a second treatment, the modified game, the procedures were the same, but responders were allowed to choose with only 80% probability. With 20% probability, responders were restricted to keep any money passed. Only responders knew whether they were restricted or not. We find that the behavior of responders is different in this modified trust game. The fact that responders can hide selfish acts generates more selfish behavior. This in turn makes proposers less likely to pass money to responders, thereby destroying trust. We find important session effects in the standard trust game but less so in the modified game. Our experiments show that information conveyed in actions is important to subjects' decisions [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT].","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Castillo","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Leo","given":"Gregory"}],"container-title":"Southern Economic Journal; Stillwater","ISSN":"00384038","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10]]},"language":"English","page":"271-281","source":"ProQuest","title":"Moral hazard and reciprocity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/755051051/abstract/917B6435FCD54BF5PQ/1","volume":"77"},

  {"id":"caviola2021","abstract":"Most people hold that it is wrong to sacrifice some humans to save a greater number of humans. Do people also think that it is wrong to sacrifice some animals to save a greater number of animals, or do they answer such questions about harm to animals by engaging in a utilitarian cost-benefit calculation? Across 10 studies (N = 4,662), using hypothetical and real-life sacrificial moral dilemmas, we found that participants considered it more permissible to harm a few animals to save a greater number of animals than to harm a few humans to save a greater number of humans. This was explained by a reduced general aversion to harm animals compared with humans, which was partly driven by participants perceiving animals to suffer less and to have lower cognitive capacity than humans. However, the effect persisted even in cases where animals were described as having greater suffering capacity and greater cognitive capacity than some humans, and even when participants felt more socially connected to animals than to humans. The reduced aversion to harming animals was thus also partly due to speciesism—the tendency to ascribe lower moral value to animals due to their species-membership alone. In sum, our studies show that deontological constraints against instrumental harm are not absolute but get weaker the less people morally value the respective entity. These constraints are strongest for humans, followed by dogs, chimpanzees, pigs, and finally inanimate objects.

  {"id":"chiappori2019","abstract":"This paper examines cross-cultural evidence of the intra-spousal balance of power within the family. The traditional, ‘unitary’ model of the family, which assumes that members maximize a single utility function, has increasingly been challenged in recent decades, as a consequence of a questioning of the underlying income-pooling hypothesis, through attempts to assume differential preferences of family members, with the relative power of spouses being of particular significance. These non-unitary models treat family decisions as outcomes of interactions between the spouses. We focus here on collective models, which have been most widely used for that purpose. We show international evidence on the basis of the UN Human Development Index 2018. Data results indicate that, in both developed (very high and top medium HDI) and non-developed (bottom medium and low HDI) cultural areas, non-unitary models, in which intra-spousal bargaining power plays a role, are empirically accepted. The Pareto-optimality hypothesis of collective models has been accepted for most statistical data bases. In developed cultural areas, wives, on average, control between one half and two thirds of household resources, with the highest bargaining power affecting expenditure patterns. As the bargaining power of women grows, allocations to education and school attendance also tend to grow in most countries.","author":[{"family":"Chiappori","given":"Pierre-André"},{"family":"Molina","given":"José Alberto"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"1 the intra-spousal balance of power within the family : cross-cultural evidence","title-short":"1 the intra-spousal balance of power within the family","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"clifford2015","abstract":"Research on the emotional, cognitive, and social determinants of moral judgment has surged in recent years. The development of moral foundations theory (MFT) has played an important role, demonstrating the breadth of morality. Moral psychology has responded by investigating how different domains of moral judgment are shaped by a variety of psychological factors. Yet, the discipline lacks a validated set of moral violations that span the moral domain, creating a barrier to investigating influences on judgment and how their neural bases might vary across the moral domain. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by developing and validating a large set of moral foundations vignettes (MFVs). Each vignette depicts a behavior violating a particular moral foundation and not others. The vignettes are controlled on many dimensions including syntactic structure and complexity making them suitable for neuroimaging research. We demonstrate the validity of our vignettes by examining respondents’ classifications of moral violations, conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and demonstrating the correspondence between the extracted factors and existing measures of the moral foundations. We expect that the MFVs will be beneficial for a wide variety of behavioral and neuroimaging investigations of moral cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Iyengar","given":"Vijeth"},{"family":"Cabeza","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Sinnott-Armstrong","given":"Walter"}],"container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-014-0551-2","ISSN":"1554-3528","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1178-1198","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Moral foundations vignettes: a standardized stimulus database of scenarios based on moral foundations theory","title-short":"Moral foundations vignettes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13428-014-0551-2","volume":"47"},

In the current study, 329 participants in committed romantic relationships completed measures of their dominance orientation, prestige orientation, and mate retention behavior. It was predicted that dominance-oriented partners would engage in tactics designed to force or coerce relationship commitment, whereas prestige-oriented partners (primarily men) would engage in tactics such as resource display and avoid costly strategies such as rival violence. Results confirmed these hypotheses. Dominance-oriented individuals imposed costs on their partners and intrasexual rivals; prestige-oriented individuals, in contrast, attempted to increase their partners’ satisfaction by enhancing positive aspects of their relationships. These results suggest that romantic partners engage in strategic mate retention tactics corresponding with their dispositional levels of dominance and prestige motivation.

  {"id":"conroy2016","abstract":"Introduction: Power imbalances within sexual relationships have signiﬁcant implications for HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. Little is known about how power inﬂuences the quality of a relationship, which could be an important pathway leading to healthy behavior around HIV/AIDS.\nMethods: This paper uses data from 448 heterosexual couples (896 individuals) in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa who completed baseline surveys from 2012 to 2014 as part of a couples-based HIV intervention trial. Using an actor-partner interdependence perspective, we assessed: (1) how both partners' perceptions of power inﬂuences their own (i.e., actor effect) and their partner's reports of relationship quality (i.e., partner effect); and (2) whether these associations differed by gender. We examined three constructs related to power (female power, male equitable gender norms, and shared power) and four domains of relationship quality (intimacy, trust, mutually constructive communication, and conﬂict).\nResults: For actor effects, shared power was strongly and consistently associated with higher relationship quality across all four domains. The effect of shared power on trust, mutually constructive communication, and conﬂict were stronger for men than women. The ﬁndings for female power and male equitable gender norms were more mixed. Female power was positively associated with women's reports of trust and mutually constructive communication, but negatively associated with intimacy. Male equitable gender norms were positively associated with men's reports of mutually constructive communication. For partner effects, male equitable gender norms were positively associated with women's reports of intimacy and negatively associated with women's reports of conﬂict.\nConclusions: Research and health interventions aiming to improving HIV-related behaviors should consider sources of shared power within couples and potential leverage points for empowerment at the couple level. Efforts solely focused on empowering women should also take the dyadic environment and men's perspectives into account to ensure positive relationship outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Conroy","given":"Amy A."},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Nuala"},{"family":"Rooyen","given":"Heidi","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hosegood","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Mallory O."},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Marr","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Ngubane","given":"Thulani"},{"family":"Darbes","given":"Lynae A."}],"container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.035","ISSN":"02779536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,3]]},"language":"en","page":"1-11","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Power and the association with relationship quality in south african couples: implications for HIV/AIDS interventions","title-short":"Power and the association with relationship quality in south african couples","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953616300363","volume":"153"},

Results indicated that high family financial stress predicts engagement in risky sexual behaviors as mediated, but not moderated, by adolescent self-regulation. The results suggest that adolescent self-regulatory capacities are a mechanism through which proximal external forces influence adolescent risk-taking. Promoting adolescent self-regulation, especially in the face of external stressors, may be an important method to reduce risk-taking behaviors as adolescents transition to adulthood.","author":[{"family":"Crandall","given":"AliceAnn"},{"family":"Magnusson","given":"Brianna"},{"family":"Novilla","given":"M."},{"family":"Novilla","given":"Lynneth Kirsten B."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"W."}],"container-title":"Journal of Youth and Adolescence","DOI":"10.1007/s10964-016-0543-x","ISSN":"0047-2891","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"eng","page":"45–62","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Family financial stress and adolescent sexual risk-taking: the role of self-regulation","title-short":"Family financial stress and adolescent sexual risk-taking","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"crandall2018","abstract":"Adolescent self-regulation is increasingly seen as an important predictor of sexual risk-taking behaviors, but little is understood about how changes in self-regulation affect later sexual risk-taking. Family financial stress may affect the development of self-regulation and later engagement in sexual risk-taking. We examined whether family financial stress influences self-regulation in early adolescence (age 13) and growth in self-regulation throughout adolescence (from age 13–17 years). We then assessed the effects of family financial stress, baseline self-regulation, and the development of self-regulation on adolescent sexual risk-taking behaviors at age 18 years. Using a curve-of-factors model, we examined these relationships in a 6-year longitudinal study of 470 adolescents (52% female) and their parents from a large northwestern city in the United States. Results indicated that family financial stress was negatively associated with baseline self-regulation but not with growth in self-regulation throughout adolescence. Both baseline self-regulation and growth in self-regulation were predictive of decreased likelihood of engaging in sexual risk-taking. Family financial stress was not predictive of later sexual risk-taking. Intervening to support the development of self-regulation in adolescence may be especially protective against later sexual risk-taking.","author":[{"family":"Crandall","given":"AliceAnn"},{"family":"Magnusson","given":"Brianna"},{"family":"Novilla","given":"M."}],"container-title":"Journal of Youth and Adolescence","DOI":"10.1007/s10964-017-0706-4","ISSN":"0047-2891","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","page":"793–806","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Growth in adolescent self-regulation and impact on sexual risk-taking: A curve-of-factors analysis","title-short":"Growth in adolescent self-regulation and impact on sexual risk-taking","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

Social information-processing patterns were assessed in these groups by presenting hypothetical vignettes to subjects. 3 hypotheses were tested: (1) only the reactive-aggressive children would demonstrate hostile biases in their attributions of peers' intentions in provocation situations (because such biases are known to lead to reactive anger); (2) only proactive-aggressive children would evaluate aggression and its consequences in relatively positive ways (because proactive aggression is motivated by its expected external outcomes); and (3) proactive-aggressive children would select instrumental social goals rather than relational goals more often than nonaggressive children.

  {"id":"critchfield2008","abstract":"Attachment theory provides a framework for understanding and predicting critical aspects of aggression in the personality disorders. An association between borderline personality disorder (BPD) and insecure forms of adult attachment marked by high relationship anxiety has been repeatedly observed in the empirical literature. Aggression also has been linked to insecure attachment. The present study extends previous work by exploring the degree to which the underlying attachment dimensions of relationship anxiety and avoidance are associated in BPD with the following forms of hostility: (a) direct aggression (verbal or physical) initiated towards others, (b) expectation/perception of aggression from others (including “reactive” counteraggression when/if provoked), (c) aggression directed towards the self in the form of suicidality or parasuicidality, and (d) affective experience of irritability or anger. The issue was studied in a sample of 92 patients diagnosed with BPD. Results show significant association between more fearful forms of attachment (simultaneous presence of relationship anxiety and avoidance) and the more reactive form of aggression involving expectation of hostility from others. Self-harm was significantly associated only with relational avoidance while anger and irritability were associated only with relational anxiety.

Asking whether these principles are invoked to explain moral judgments, we found that subjects generally appealed to the ﬁrst and third principles in their justiﬁcations, but not to the second.

Power is a central construct in economic decision making, inﬂuencing people’s thoughts and behavior in organizational, political, consumer, and interpersonal contexts. Whereas most research has discussed ways that power can inﬂuence primary cognition (e.g., increased self-focused thoughts, heuristic processing), we examine how power can inﬂuence secondary cognition (i.e., thinking about thinking). We argue that high (relative to low) power can increase reliance on one’s current thoughts, magnifying their inﬂuence on judgment. If thoughts are antisocial (prosocial), increased power will produce more antisocial (prosocial) judgments and behavior. We activated prosocial or antisocial concepts through priming before activating powerfulness or powerlessness. As predicted, primes impacted people’s self-perceptions of cooperation (Experiment 1) and the extent to which they were willing to help others (Experiment 2) when induced to feel powerful, but not when led to feel powerless.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"DeMarree","given":"Kenneth G."},{"family":"Briñol","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Petty","given":"Richard E."}],"container-title":"Journal of Economic Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.joep.2012.07.005","ISSN":"01674870","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,4]]},"language":"en","page":"20-30","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The effects of power on prosocial outcomes: A self-validation analysis","title-short":"The effects of power on prosocial outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167487012000827","volume":"41"},

Design: The data were collected preintervention during a randomized controlled HIV prevention trial. Participants were 701 sexually active, unmarried African American females, aged 14 –20, who were not pregnant, and were recruited from three health clinics in a southeastern US city. Structural equation modeling was used for the analyses. Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported condom use. Results: Theoretical associations yielded a well-fitting structural model across initial and cross-validation samples. A significant amount of variance was explained for the variables of condom use (R2 ϭ .31, .18), partner communication (R2 ϭ .30, .26), substance use during sex (R2 ϭ .32, .51), and negative personal affect (R2 ϭ .36, .48). Partner communication (.35, .38) was the strongest predictor of condom use, negative personal affect (Ϫ.41, Ϫ.37) was the strongest predictor of partner communication, and physical risk (.54, .54) was the strongest predictor of negative personal affect. Conclusion: This model provides evidence to support both direct and indirect associations between social and behavioral risk factors and condom use.

Postal questionnaires were sent to 11,086 women aged 18–70 years. Data were collected on AFSI, number of sexual partners, contraceptive methods, cervical cancer screening and socio-demographic characteristics.\nResults\nThe average AFSI was 20.9 years. AFSI below the age of 19 years was reported by 30.8% of the women. Among sexually active women, 70.6% reported being monogamous and 6.4% reported ≥5 lifetime sexual partners. Younger age at interview was strongly related to earlier AFSI and to higher number of lifetime sexual partners. Women younger than 25 were 39 times more likely to have an AFSI before age 18 than women over age 55. The percentage of women aged less than 25 reporting two or more sexual partners was four times higher than that of women 56 and older. In the multivariate analysis, having two or more sexual partners was independently associated with young age, early AFSI, having ever used oral contraceptives, living in an urban area, having had a screening Pap test in the last 3 years, having a sexually transmitted infection and nuliparity.\nConclusions\nThis study confirms important changes in the sexual behaviour of Spanish women. Younger cohorts show a younger age at sexual initiation and higher number of sexual partners. These are key factors that may induce changes in the human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and the cervical cancer incidence in Spain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sanjose","given":"Silvia","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cortés","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Méndez","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Puig-Tintore","given":"Lluis"},{"family":"Torné","given":"Aureli"},{"family":"Roura","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Bosch","given":"F.

  {"id":"desiderato1995","abstract":"To examine relationships between disclosure of previous sexually risky behavior to current sexual partners, multiple sexual partners, condom and alcohol use, and vulnerability to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, an anonymous survey was administered to 427 unmarried undergraduates. Of the 262 sexually active students (66%), one third reported having more than one sexual partner in the prior 11 weeks and three fourths reported inconsistent or no condom use. Failure to disclose having previous sexual partners, not using condoms, and testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) was common among both men and women. Students with multiple sexual partners were less likely to disclose about previous partners and about failure to use condoms, and more likely to use alcohol prior to sexual activity. Although 40.8% of respondents said they did not use or were less likely to use condoms while drinking, no relationship between alcohol and condom use assessed during the last discrete incident was found. College students continue to engage in sexual activity that puts them at risk for contracting HIV and other STDs. Self-disclosure about past risky behavior, when it occurs, does not appear to lead to higher levels of condom use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Desiderato","given":"Laurie L."},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Helen J."}],"container-title":"Journal of Youth and Adolescence","container-title-short":"J Youth Adolescence","DOI":"10.1007/BF01537560","ISSN":"1573-6601","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"55-68","source":"Springer Link","title":"Risky sexual behavior in college students: relationships between number of sexual partners, disclosure of previous risky behavior, and alcohol use","title-short":"Risky sexual behavior in college students","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01537560","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"dickson1998","abstract":"Objectives: To investigate how age at first sexual intercourse is related to the reported circumstances and to determine how these corresponded to views in early adulthood about its timing.\nDesign: Cross sectional study within a birth cohort using a questionnaire presented by computer.\nSetting: Dunedin, New Zealand in 1993-4.\nSubjects: 477 men and 458 women enrolled in the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, comprising 92% of survivors of the cohort.\nResults: The median age at first intercourse was 17 years for men and 16 years for women. Only one man (0.2%) but 30 (7%) women reported being forced to have intercourse on the first occasion. For women, there were increasing rates of coercion with younger age at first intercourse. More men than women reported that they and their partner were equally willing (77% (316/413) v 53% (222/419)). Mutual willingness of both partners was greater for those who reported that it was also the first time for their partner. Timing of first intercourse was considered about right by 49% (200/411) of men and 38% (148/388) of women. Many women (54% (211/388) reported that they should have waited longer, and this rose to 70% (90/129) for women reporting intercourse before age 16.\nConclusions: Most women regretted having sexual intercourse before age 16. First intercourse at younger ages is associated with risks that are shared unequally between men and women.

  {"id":"dienes2020","abstract":"This article provides guidance on interpreting and reporting Bayesian hypothesis tests, in order to aid their understanding. To use and report a Bayesian hypothesis test, predicted effect sizes must be specified. The paper will provide guidance in specifying effect sizes of interest (which also will be of relevance to those using frequentist statistics).  First, if a minimally interesting effect size can be specified, a null interval is defined as the effects smaller in magnitude than the minimally interesting effect.  Then the proportion of the posterior distribution that falls in the null interval indicates the plausibility of the null interval hypothesis. Second, if a rough scale of effect can be determined, a Bayes factor can indicate evidence for a model representing that scale of effect versus a model of H0. Both methods allow data to count against a theory that predicts a difference. By contrast, non-significance does not count against such a theory. Various examples are provided including the suitability of Bayesian analyses for demonstrating the absence of conscious perception under putative subliminal conditions, and its presence in supraliminal conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dienes","given":"Zoltan"}],"DOI":"10.31234/osf.io/bua5n","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,3]]},"publisher":"PsyArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"How to use and report bayesian hypothesis tests","type":"report","URL":"https://psyarxiv.com/bua5n/"},

For example, are the wealthy more or less likely to accept an unfair offer in an ultimatum game where it is costly to reject an unfair offer? How about when it is not costly to reject an unfair offer? In the present research, we measured self-reported wealth (i.e., family income, Studies 1–3) and manipulated wealth using a “lucky draw” game (Studies 2 and 3) to examine how wealth affects responses to unfairness in an ultimatum game (Studies 1–3) and a new game called the cost-free rejection game (CFRG, Study 3). Across three studies, we found that wealthy people rejected an unfair offer (i.e., being offered 20% while the other kept 80% of the endowment) more frequently than the less wealthy, and that this tendency to reject unfairness was mediated by their increased feelings of entitlement. This suggests that the wealthy, or even people who temporarily perceive themselves to be wealthy, are more easily offended by unfairness than the less wealthy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Junhui"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Van Lange","given":"Paul A.

Subsequently, subjects negotiated through computers with opponents (in reality, simulated by a computer), who sent compellent threats or promises designed to induce some desired behavior. Higher levels of the focal negotiator's coercive power increased communication of threats but did not influence level of demand. Higher levels of the opponent's coercive power produced greater decline in level of demand but only when the opponent sent threats instead of promises. Power balance produced less communication of threats and greater decline of demand than power preponderance.

This possibility is particularly stark in Bayesian hypothesis testing: To use this increasingly popular approach, researchers specify the effect size they are expecting (the “prior mean”), which is then incorporated into the final statistical results. Because the prior mean represents an expression of confidence that one is studying a large effect, we reasoned that scientists who are more confident in their research skills may be inclined to select larger prior means. Across two preregistered studies with more than 900 active researchers in psychology, we showed that more self-confident researchers selected larger prior means. We also found suggestive but somewhat inconsistent evidence that men may choose larger prior means than women, due in part to gender differences in researcher self-confidence.

  {"id":"ebenbach1998","abstract":"This investigation examined whether ideological opponents' emotion and relative power in a conflict would influence the accuracy with which they judge their own side's and their opponents' attitudes. Based on accounts linking power and emotion to perceptual vigilance, we proposed that opposing partisans will be prone to stereotype their opponents as extremists, as the result of a heuristic, effort-saving strategy, unless motivated by lower relative power or increased emotion to make more accurate judgments. We predicted that members of powerful groups would judge the views of other groups inaccurately, that all groups would have inaccurate views of less powerful groups, and that high levels of negative emotion with regard to the conflict would be associated with more accurate judgments. Two studies yielded certain findings consistent with these predictions. In Study 1, powerful majority partisans were less accurate judges but more accurately judged than less powerful minority partisans across two social issues. Study 2 focused on two activist groups embroiled in a conflict over status and funding within the university setting, the power being held a Gay Pride group. Consistent with hypotheses, a self-reported sense of power and reduced negative emotion were both associated with reduced judgmental accuracy. Discussion focused on the underlying mechanisms that might account for the effects of power and emotion upon social judgment and the social implications of these asymmetries in judgmental accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ebenbach","given":"David H."},{"family":"Keltner","given":"Dacher"}],"container-title":"Basic and Applied Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1207/s15324834basp2001_2","ISSN":"0197-3533","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,3,1]]},"page":"7-21","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Power, emotion, and judgmental accuracy in social conflict: motivating the cognitive miser","title-short":"Power, emotion, and judgmental accuracy in social conflict","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15324834basp2001_2","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"emerson1962","abstract":"A simple theory of power relations is developed in an effort to resolve some of the ambiguities surrounding \"power,\" \"authority,\" \"legitimacy,\" and power \"structures,\" through bringing them together in a coherent scheme. After defining a reciprocal power-dependence relation, attention is focused upon properties of balance and \"balancing operations\" in such relations. The theory dictates exactly four generic types of balancing process, and discussion of these leads directly into processes of group formation, including the emergence of group norms, role structure and status hierarchy, all presented as the outcome of balancing tendencies in power relations. Within the framework of this theory, authority appears quite naturally to be legitimized power, vested in roles, and \"legitimation\" is seen as a special case of the coalition process through which norms and role-prescriptions are formed. Finally, through treating both persons and groups as actors in a power-network (two or more connected power-dependence relations) the door is opened for meaningful analysis of complex power structures. Brief reference is made to findings from two experiments pertaining to hypotheses advanced in this theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Emerson","given":"Richard M."}],"container-title":"American Sociological Review","DOI":"10.2307/2089716","ISSN":"0003-1224","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1962]]},"page":"31-41","source":"JSTOR","title":"Power-dependence relations","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/2089716","volume":"27"},

Various studies have linked physical disgust to moral disgust, but despite the rich and sometimes striking findings these studies have yielded, no research has explored morality in conjunction with taste, which can vary greatly and may differentially affect cognition. The research reported here tested the effects of taste perception on moral judgments. After consuming a sweet beverage, a bitter beverage, or water, participants rated a variety of moral transgressions. Results showed that taste perception significantly affected moral judgments, such that physical disgust (induced via a bitter taste) elicited feelings of moral disgust. Further, this effect was more pronounced in participants with politically conservative views than in participants with politically liberal views.Taken together, these differential findings suggest that embodied gustatory experiences may affect moral processing more than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Eskine","given":"Kendall J."},{"family":"Kacinik","given":"Natalie A."},{"family":"Prinz","given":"Jesse J."}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/0956797611398497","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3]]},"language":"en","page":"295-299","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A bad taste in the mouth: gustatory disgust influences moral judgment","title-short":"A bad taste in the mouth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611398497","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"evans2021","abstract":"One of the most interesting findings in multialternative, multiattribute choice is the occurrence of “context effects,” where the relative preference between two alternatives is influenced by a third, decoy alternative. Although context effects have been well documented, the circumstances necessary for them to occur is a puzzle. Sometimes, the effects disappear or reverse, suggesting they are fragile. We hypothesize this fragility is partly due to a sequential comparison process where subsets of options are compared and evaluated during deliberation. Thus, manipulating the comparison of options (by manipulating presentation order of options) should influence the manifestation of these effect. We test this hypothesis in two ways for the attraction effect. First, we develop a temporally sequential version of a well-established perceptual context effects paradigm, where participants only see 1 alternative at a time. Results show that presentation order strongly influences choices. In some orders, a standard attraction effect occurs and in others, a reversal (or “repulsion”) effect occurs. A piecewise extension of the Multiattribute Linear Ballistic Accumulator model explains our results by showing how forgetting (due to the sequential presentation) influences the comparison of options. Quantitative fitting demonstrates that the model explains well the data, outperforming alternative heuristic models. Second, we reanalyze attraction effect data from Trueblood et al. (2015) where the spatial order of options was manipulated. Similar to the sequential task, results show a complex pattern of attraction and repulsion effects. Taken together, these results indicate that a malleable comparison process contributes to the fragility of context effects.

  {"id":"fadda2016","abstract":"This paper adds to the growing research on moral judgment (MJ) by considering whether theory of mind (ToM) might foster children’s autonomous MJ achievement. A group of 30 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was compared in MJ and ToM with 30 typically developing (TD) children. Participants were tested for MJ with a classical Piaget’s task and for ToM with a second order False Belief task. In the moral task, children were told two versions of a story: in one version the protagonist acted according to a moral intention but the action resulted in a harmful consequence; in the other version the protagonist acted according to an immoral intention, but the action resulted in a harmless consequence. Children were asked which of the two protagonists was the “naughtier.” In line with previous studies, the results indicated that, while the majority of TD participants succeeded in the second order False Belief task, only few individuals with ASD showed intact perspective taking abilities. The analysis of the MJ in relation to ToM showed that children with ASD lacking ToM abilities judged guilty the protagonists of the two versions of the story in the moral task because both of them violated a moral rule or because they considered the consequences of the actions, ignoring any psychological information. These results indicate a heteronomous morality in individuals with ASD, based on the respect of learned moral rules and outcomes rather than others’ subjective states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fadda","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Parisi","given":"Marinella"},{"family":"Ferretti","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Saba","given":"Gessica"},{"family":"Foscoliano","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Salvago","given":"Azzurra"},{"family":"Doneddu","given":"Giuseppe"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00523","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,18]]},"PMCID":"PMC4834434","PMID":"27148131","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Exploring the role of theory of mind in moral judgment: the case of children with autism spectrum disorder","title-short":"Exploring the role of theory of mind in moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834434/","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"fehr2002","abstract":"This paper provides strong evidence challenging the self-interest assumption that dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking. The evidence indicates that many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. We call this behavioral propensity “strong reciprocity” and show empirically that it can lead to almost universal cooperation in circumstances in which purely self-interested behavior would cause a complete breakdown of cooperation. In addition, we show that people are willing to punish those who behaved unfairly towards a third person or who defected in a Prisoner’s Dilemma game with a third person. This suggests that strong reciprocity is a powerful device for the enforcement of social norms involving, for example, food sharing or collective action. Strong reciprocity cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation (in other words, kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly signaling theory). However, multilevel selection theories of cultural evolution are consistent with strong reciprocity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehr","given":"Ernst"},{"family":"Fischbacher","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Gächter","given":"Simon"}],"container-title":"Human Nature","container-title-short":"Hum Nat","DOI":"10.1007/s12110-002-1012-7","ISSN":"1936-4776","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-25","source":"Springer Link","title":"Strong reciprocity, human cooperation, and the enforcement of social norms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-002-1012-7","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"feinberg2012","abstract":"A classic problem in moral psychology concerns whether and when moral judgments are driven by intuition versus deliberate reasoning. In this investigation, we explored the role of reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy that involves construing an emotion-eliciting situation in a way that diminishes the intensity of the emotional experience. We hypothesized that although emotional reactions evoke initial moral intuitions, reappraisal weakens the influence of these intuitions, leading to more deliberative moral judgments. Three studies of moral judgments in emotionally evocative, disgust-eliciting moral dilemmas supported our hypothesis. A greater tendency to reappraise was related to fewer intuition-based judgments (Study 1). Content analysis of open-ended descriptions of moral-reasoning processes revealed that reappraisal was associated with longer time spent in deliberation and with fewer intuitionist moral judgments (Study 2). Finally, in comparison with participants who simply watched an emotion-inducing film, participants who had been instructed to reappraise their reactions while watching the film subsequently reported less intense emotional reactions to moral dilemmas, and these dampened reactions led, in turn, to fewer intuitionist moral judgments (Study 3).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Feinberg","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Willer","given":"Robb"},{"family":"Antonenko","given":"Olga"},{"family":"John","given":"Oliver P."}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"page":"788-795","source":"JSTOR","title":"Liberating reason from the passions: overriding intuitionist moral judgments through emotion reappraisal","title-short":"Liberating reason from the passions","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/23262496","volume":"23"},

We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an ‘affect heuristic’ which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source—affective reactions to the stimulus item.

At a later session, stimulus people were depicted by category labels (occupations) and relevant attributes (traits) in varying combinations. Typicality ratings confirmed the manipulated ease of categorizing the various information combinations. Correlations between subjects' evaluations of each stimulus person and their independent prior ratings of the components supported the idea of a continuum anchored respectively by relatively category-based and by relatively attribute-based impression formation processes. In the second study, think-aloud data further supported the current hypotheses: subjects spontaneously examined the fit between category and attributes, and they used the attributes more in the attribute-based conditions than in the category-based conditions. The protocol data also reveal some processes intermediate on the continuum between primarily category-based and primarily attribute-based processes; these include subcategorizing, generating new categories, and self-reference.

Promoting survival, these dimensions provide fundamental social structural answers about competition and status.

For good reasons, people object to being stereotyped, categorized, and attributed certain characteristics in common. People do not want to be stereotyped because it limits their freedom and constrains their outcomes, even their lives. In short, stereotypes exert control. Obviously, stereotypes exert control through prejudice and discrimination. Victims of stereotyping know this and rightly resist stereotypes for those reasons.

Observers read stories about a game of backgammon in which the male target either strongly wished for one particular outcome of the roll of the dice or was indifferent and in which either the target rolled the dice himself or a third party rolled the dice for him. Results showed that when the target desired a particular consequence of the dice roll in advance and rolled the dice himself, observers were more likely to see him as having exerted influence over the dice roll, were willing to wager more that he could roll the same number again, and rated luck as less influential in producing the dice roll outcome.

  {"id":"fleming2012","abstract":"Neuroscience has made considerable progress in understanding the neural substrates supporting cognitive performance in a number of domains, including memory, perception, and decision making. In contrast, how the human brain generates metacognitive awareness of task performance remains unclear. Here, we address this question by asking participants to perform perceptual decisions while providing concurrent metacognitive reports during fMRI scanning. We show that activity in right rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) satisfies three constraints for a role in metacognitive aspects of decision-making. Right rlPFC showed greater activity during self-report compared to a matched control condition, activity in this region correlated with reported confidence, and the strength of the relationship between activity and confidence predicted metacognitive ability across individuals. In addition, functional connectivity between right rlPFC and both contralateral PFC and visual cortex increased during metacognitive reports. We discuss these findings in a theoretical framework where rlPFC re-represents object-level decision uncertainty to facilitate metacognitive report.","author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"S.

  {"id":"fleming2017","abstract":"People are often aware of their mistakes, and report levels of confidence in their choices that correlate with objective performance. These metacognitive assessments of decision quality are important for the guidance of behavior, particularly when external feedback is absent or sporadic. However, a computational framework that accounts for both confidence and error detection is lacking. In addition, accounts of dissociations between performance and metacognition have often relied on ad hoc assumptions, precluding a unified account of intact and impaired self-evaluation. Here we present a general Bayesian framework in which self-evaluation is cast as a “second-order” inference on a coupled but distinct decision system, computationally equivalent to inferring the performance of another actor. Second-order computation may ensue whenever there is a separation between internal states supporting decisions and confidence estimates over space and/or time. We contrast second-order computation against simpler first-order models in which the same internal state supports both decisions and confidence estimates. Through simulations we show that second-order computation provides a unified account of different types of self-evaluation often considered in separate literatures, such as confidence and error detection, and generates novel predictions about the contribution of one’s own actions to metacognitive judgments. In addition, the model provides insight into why subjects’ metacognition may sometimes be better or worse than task performance. We suggest that second-order computation may underpin self-evaluative judgments across a range of domains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Daw","given":"Nathaniel D."}],"container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychological Review","DOI":"10.1037/rev0000045","ISSN":"1939-1471, 0033-295X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1]]},"language":"en","page":"91-114","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Self-evaluation of decision-making: A general bayesian framework for metacognitive computation.","title-short":"Self-evaluation of decision-making","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/rev0000045","volume":"124"},

We investigate the role of negative assortment in the evolution of fair play in the ultimatum game. Spite—social behaviour that inflicts harm with no direct benefit to the actor—can evolve when it is disproportionally directed at individuals playing different strategies. The introduction of negative assortment alters the dynamics in a way that increases the chance fairness evolves, but at a cost: spite also evolves.

The present study tested two potential driving mechanisms of risk-taking by narcissists (i.e., heightened perceptions of benefits and diminished perceptions of risks stemming from risky behaviors) by administering survey measures of narcissism and risk-taking to a sample of 605 undergraduate college students. Contrary to what might be expected, the results suggest that narcissists appreciate the risks associated with risky behaviors just as much as do less narcissistic individuals. Their risk-taking appears to instead be fueled by heightened perceptions of benefits stemming from risky behaviors. These results are consistent with a growing body of evidence suggesting that narcissists engage in some forms of potentially problematic behaviors, such as risk-taking, because of a surplus of eagerness rather than a deficit of inhibition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Foster","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Shenesey","given":"Jessica W."},{"family":"Goff","given":"Joshua S."}],"container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2009.07.008","ISSN":"0191-8869","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"885-889","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Why do narcissists take more risks?

  {"id":"garofalo2019","abstract":"Psychopathy has long been conceptualized in terms of an absence of emotion. Yet, recent studies have suggested that the experience of other-directed negative emotions may be more intimately linked to psychopathy than previously acknowledged, although there is limited knowledge concerning the experience of such emotions. The present study examined the disposition to experience two other-directed emotions, spitefulness and contempt, that are conceptually linked with psychopathy but currently are limited in empirical support. Across 2 studies with 3 nonclinical samples (Ns ϭ 1,237, 239, 521), we found evidence that psychopathic traits—as assessed via the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (SRP; Paulhus, Neumann, & Hare, 2016; Study 1 and Study 2) and the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM; Patrick, 2010; Study 2)—were positively associated with spitefulness (Study 1) and contempt (Study 2). These associations were consistent across psychopathy instruments (SRP and TriPM) and dimensions (i.e., the SRP Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle, and Antisocial facets, and the TriPM Meanness and Disinhibition dimensions), were stronger for the interpersonal and affective traits of psychopathy, and held when accounting for several theoretically relevant covariates. The only exception concerned the TriPM Boldness scale, which had less consistent associations with contempt. The present findings further our understanding of the emotional experiences related to psychopathy, highlighting the relevance of focusing on other-directed negative emotions, especially those that are interpersonal in nature and share an antagonistic component.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Garofalo","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Neumann","given":"Craig S."},{"family":"Zeigler-Hill","given":"Virgil"},{"family":"Meloy","given":"J.

Our objective was to understand the context, issues, and beliefs around high STI rates from a nêhiyaw (Cree) perspective. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 community participants between March 1, 2011 and May 15, 2011. Interviews were conducted by community researchers and grounded in the Cree values of relationship, sharing, personal agency and relational accountability. A diverse purposive snowball sample of community members were asked why they thought STI rates were high for the community. The remainder of the interview was unstructured, and supported by the interviewer through probes and sharing in a conversational style. Modiﬁed grounded theory was used to analyze the narratives and develop a theory. The main ﬁnding from the interviews was that abuse of power in relationships causes physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wounds that disrupt the medicine wheel. Wounded individuals seek medicine to stop suffering and ﬁnd healing. Many numb suffering by accessing temporary medicines (sex, drugs and alcohol) or permanent medicines (suicide). These medicines increase the risk of STIs. Some seek healing by participating in ceremony and restoring relationships with self, others, Spirit/religion, traditional knowledge and traditional teachings. These medicines decrease the risk of STIs. Younger female participants explained how casual relationships are safer than committed monogamous relationships.

Individuals high in moral identity, however, did not show elevated levels of cheating when they were depleted (Study 3), supporting our hypothesis that self-control depletion increases cheating when it robs people of the executive resources necessary to identify an act as immoral or unethical. Our results also show that resisting unethical behavior both requires and depletes self-control resources (Study 4). Taken together, our findings help to explain how otherwise ethical individuals predictably engage in unethical behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gino","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Schweitzer","given":"Maurice E."},{"family":"Mead","given":"Nicole L."},{"family":"Ariely","given":"Dan"}],"container-title":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","container-title-short":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","DOI":"10.1016/j.obhdp.2011.03.001","ISSN":"0749-5978","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"191-203","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Unable to resist temptation: how self-control depletion promotes unethical behavior","title-short":"Unable to resist temptation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597811000422","volume":"115"},
  {"id":"gintis2003","abstract":"Recent experimental research has revealed forms of human behavior involving interaction among unrelated individuals that have proven difficult to explain in terms of kin or reciprocal altruism. One such trait, strong reciprocity is a predisposition to cooperate with others and to punish those who violate the norms of cooperation, at personal cost, even when it is implausible to expect that these costs will be repaid. We present evidence supporting strong reciprocity as a schema for predicting and understanding altruism in humans. We show that under conditions plausibly characteristic of the early stages of human evolution, a small number of strong reciprocators could invade a population of self-regarding types, and strong reciprocity is an evolutionary stable strategy. Although most of the evidence we report is based on behavioral experiments, the same behaviors are regularly described in everyday life, for example, in wage setting by firms, tax compliance, and cooperation in the protection of local environmental public goods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gintis","given":"Herbert"},{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Boyd","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Fehr","given":"Ernst"}],"container-title":"Evolution and Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Evolution and Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/S1090-5138(02)00157-5","ISSN":"1090-5138","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"153-172","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Explaining altruistic behavior in humans","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513802001575","volume":"24"},

To fill the need for reliable and theoretically grounded measurement of the full range of moral concerns, we developed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire on the basis of a theoretical model of 5 universally available (but variably developed) sets of moral intuitions: Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, Ingroup/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity. We present evidence for the internal and external validity of the scale and the model, and in doing so we present new findings about morality: (a) Comparative model fitting of confirmatory factor analyses provides empirical justification for a 5-factor structure of moral concerns; (b) convergent/discriminant validity evidence suggests that moral concerns predict personality features and social group attitudes not previously considered morally relevant; and (c) we establish pragmatic validity of the measure in providing new knowledge and research opportunities concerning demographic and cultural differences in moral intuitions.

  {"id":"gray2012","abstract":"Mind perception entails ascribing mental capacities to other entities, whereas moral judgment entails labeling entities as good or bad or actions as right or wrong. We suggest that mind perception is the essence of moral judgment. In particular, we suggest that moral judgment is rooted in a cognitive template of two perceived minds—a moral dyad of an intentional agent and a suffering moral patient. Diverse lines of research support dyadic morality. First, perceptions of mind are linked to moral judgments: dimensions of mind perception (agency and experience) map onto moral types (agents and patients), and deficits of mind perception correspond to difficulties with moral judgment. Second, not only are moral judgments sensitive to perceived agency and experience, but all moral transgressions are fundamentally understood as agency plus experienced suffering—that is, interpersonal harm—even ostensibly harmless acts such as purity violations. Third, dyadic morality uniquely accounts for the phenomena of dyadic completion (seeing agents in response to patients, and vice versa), and moral typecasting (characterizing others as either moral agents or moral patients). Discussion also explores how mind perception can unify morality across explanatory levels, how a dyadic template of morality may be developmentally acquired, and future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Young","given":"Liane"},{"family":"Waytz","given":"Adam"}],"container-title":"Psychological Inquiry","DOI":"10.1080/1047840X.2012.651387","ISSN":"1047-840X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,1]]},"page":"101-124","PMID":"22754268","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Mind perception is the essence of morality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1047840X.2012.651387","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"greene2009","abstract":"In some cases people judge it morally acceptable to sacriﬁce one person’s life in order to save several other lives, while in other similar cases they make the opposite judgment. Researchers have identiﬁed two general factors that may explain this phenomenon at the stimulus level: (1) the agent’s intention (i.e. whether the harmful event is intended as a means or merely foreseen as a side-effect) and (2) whether the agent harms the victim in a manner that is relatively ‘‘direct” or ‘‘personal”. Here we integrate these two classes of ﬁndings. Two experiments examine a novel personalness/directness factor that we call personal force, present when the force that directly impacts the victim is generated by the agent’s muscles (e.g., in pushing). Experiments 1a and b demonstrate the inﬂuence of personal force on moral judgment, distinguishing it from physical contact and spatial proximity. Experiments 2a and b demonstrate an interaction between personal force and intention, whereby the effect of personal force depends entirely on intention. These studies also introduce a method for controlling for people’s real-world expectations in decisions involving potentially unrealistic hypothetical dilemmas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Greene","given":"Joshua D."},{"family":"Cushman","given":"Fiery A."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Lisa E."},{"family":"Lowenberg","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Nystrom","given":"Leigh E."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jonathan D."}],"container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2009.02.001","ISSN":"00100277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,6]]},"language":"en","page":"364-371","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pushing moral buttons: the interaction between personal force and intention in moral judgment","title-short":"Pushing moral buttons","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027709000420","volume":"111"},

Yet these relations haven’t been well established for Chinese children, and the underlying mechanisms were seldom explored. Drawing upon parental acceptance-rejection theory and empathy-altruism hypothesis, the objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between perceived parenting styles and altruistic behavior of children, and the intervening role of children’s empathy and the moderating role of in-group and out-group conditions. What is novel about this study is that it contains both survey data and experimental data. Four hundred and ninety-four children (Mage = 8.92 years) completed four simple binary-choice dictator games which are widely used in the study of other-regarding preferences (concerns for the interests of others). These children also reported their perceived parenting styles. And children’s empathy was reported by their mothers. Each child’s altruism score, which was used in the subsequent analyses, was derived from the altruistic choices in these games. Mediation analyses indicated that, when age and gender were controlled for, maternal and paternal emotional warmth were positively associated with children’s altruism via children’s empathy, while maternal and paternal rejection were negatively associated with children’s altruism via children’s empathy. Multi-group analyses showed that the influences of perceived parenting styles on children’s altruistic behavior via children’s empathy were consistent for in-group and out-group conditions. These findings suggest that enhancing parental emotional warmth and reducing parental rejection may foster children’s empathy, which in turn promote children’s altruism. Limitations and future directions of this study were also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Qingke"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Linlin"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front Psychol","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01843","ISSN":"1664-1078","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,16]]},"PMCID":"PMC5650632","PMID":"29085324","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The associations between perceived parenting styles, empathy, and altruistic choices in economic games: A study of chinese children","title-short":"The associations between perceived parenting styles, empathy, and altruistic choices in economic games","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5650632/","volume":"8"},

In both experiments, high-power participants attributed fewer uniquely human traits to low-power participants than vice versa, meaning they animalistically dehumanized a fellow student from the same university.

Attempts to secure the gains are easily understood to be adaptive: this is the fundamental response to what Darwin called the “struggle for existence”. But, considering the more controversial catch-phrase of evolutionary theory—“the survival of the fittest”—it seems to be a neglected question whether the harm delivered to an adversary is always merely an unfortunate consequence of adaptations for survival. Could such harm ever be adaptive in itself ? Or nearer, to the possibility of a test, would we ever expect an animal to be ready to harm itself in order to harm another more ?

  {"id":"hao2016","abstract":"The rationalistic theories of morality emphasize that reasoning plays an important role in moral judgments and prosocial behavior. Theory of mind as a reasoning ability in the mental domain has been considered a facilitator of moral development. The present study examined whether theory of mind was consistently positively associated with morality from middle childhood to late adulthood. Two hundred four participants, including 48 elementary school children, 45 adolescents, 62 younger adults and 49 older adults, completed theory of mind, moral judgment and prosocial behavior tasks. Theory of mind was measured with strange stories that tapped into an understanding of lies, white lies, double bluffs, irony and persuasion. Moral judgments were measured with variants of the trolley dilemma. Prosocial behavior was measured through participants’ performance in an interactive situation in which a helping request was made. The results indicated specific rather than similar developmental trajectories of theory of mind, moral judgments and prosocial behavior. There was a quadratic trend in theory of mind, a combination of quadratic and cubic trends in deontological moral judgments and a linear decline in helping behavior. It is thus suggested that theory of mind may not be associated with morality in an unchanging way during development. Further results indicated that theory of mind and deontological moral judgments were negatively correlated for children, adolescents and older adults but positively correlated for younger adults. Theory of mind and helping behavior were positively correlated for children but negatively correlated for adolescents. However, the relationships disappeared in adulthood. In sum, the present study reveals that theory of mind may be a nice tool for its facilitation of deontological moral judgments and prosocial behavior, but it may also be a nasty tool for its blocking of deontological moral judgments and prosocial behavior. Moreover, theory of mind may be a permanent tool for moral judgment development but a temporary tool for prosocial behavior development. Thus, the present study enriches the rationalistic theories of morality from a developmental perspective. Different relationships between theory of mind and morality from middle childhood to late adulthood are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hao","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yanchun"}],"container-title":"Frontiers in Psychology","container-title-short":"Front.

Second, we review who is dehumanized, examining the social targets that have been shown to be denied humanness and commonalities among them. Third, we investigate who dehumanizes, notably the personality, ideological, and other individual differences that increase the propensity to see others as less than human. Fourth, we explore when people dehumanize, focusing on transient situational and motivational factors that promote dehumanizing perceptions. Fifth, we examine the consequences of dehumanization, emphasizing its implications for prosocial and antisocial behavior and for moral judgment.

  {"id":"hauser2009","abstract":"Darwin never provided a satisfactory account of altruism, but posed the problem beautifully in light of the logic of natural selection. Hamilton and Williams delivered the necessary satisfaction by appealing to kinship, and Trivers showed that kinship was not necessary as long as the originally altruistic act was conditionally reciprocated. From the late 1970s to the present, the kinship theories in particular have been supported by considerable empirical data and elaborated to explore a number of other social interactions such as cooperation, selfishness and punishment, giving us what is now a rich description of the nature of social relationships among organisms. There are, however, two forms of theoretically possible social interactions—reciprocity and spite—that appear absent or nearly so in non-human vertebrates, despite considerable research efforts on a wide diversity of species. We suggest that the rather weak comparative evidence for these interactions is predicted once we consider the requisite socioecological pressures and psychological mechanisms. That is, a consideration of ultimate demands and proximate prerequisites leads to the prediction that reciprocity and spite should be rare in non-human animals, and common in humans. In particular, reciprocity and spite evolved in humans because of adaptive demands on cooperation among unrelated individuals living in large groups, and the integrative capacities of inequity detection, future-oriented decision-making and inhibitory control.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,5]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Hauser","given":"Marc"},{"family":"McAuliffe","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Blake","given":"Peter R."}],"container-title":"Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1533","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"page":"3255-3266","source":"JSTOR","title":"Evolving the ingredients for reciprocity and spite","type":"article-journal","URL":"www.jstor.org/stable/40485786","volume":"364"},

  {"id":"heekeren2005","abstract":"Moral decision-making is central to everyday social life because the evaluation of the actions of another agent or our own actions made with respect to the norms and values guides our behavior in a community. There is previous evidence that the presence of bodily harm--even if irrelevant for a decision--may affect the decision-making process. While recent neuroimaging studies found a common neural substrate of moral decision-making, the role of bodily harm has not been systematically studied so far. Here we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how behavioral and neural correlates of semantic and moral decision-making processes are modulated by the presence of direct bodily harm or violence in the stimuli. Twelve participants made moral and semantic decisions about sentences describing actions of agents that either contained bodily harm or not and that could easily be judged as being good or bad or correct/incorrect, respectively. During moral and semantic decision-making, the presence of bodily harm resulted in faster response times (RT) and weaker activity in the temporal poles relative to trials devoid of bodily harm/violence, indicating a processing advantage and reduced processing depth for violence-related linguistic stimuli. Notably, there was no increase in activity in the amygdala and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in response to trials containing bodily harm. These findings might be a correlate of limited generation of the semantic and emotional context in the anterior temporal poles during the evaluation of actions of another agent related to violence that is made with respect to the norms and values guiding our behavior in a community.","author":[{"family":"Heekeren","given":"Hauke R."},{"family":"Wartenburger","given":"Isabell"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Helge"},{"family":"Prehn","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Schwintowski","given":"Hans-Peter"},{"family":"Villringer","given":"Arno"}],"container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"Neuroimage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.026","ISSN":"1053-8119","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,2,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"887-897","PMID":"15652323","source":"PubMed","title":"Influence of bodily harm on neural correlates of semantic and moral decision-making","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"hertz2018","abstract":"Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices' payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants' probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options' payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions' time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a \"stochastic satisficing\" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen option's thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants' decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence.

Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions.

  {"id":"hill2007","abstract":"In the last 10 years, researchers have developed separate rating scales for men and women that purport to measure a person's thoughts about their sexual self or sexual self-schema. While these scales are promising, there are some problems intrinsic to these measures. This study addresses these concerns and tests a combined measure for use among both men and women, while retaining internal consistency and a factor structure similar to the women's scale. Having both men and women complete the same scale permitted a comparison of how men and women think about their sexual selves. In this study, gender differences netted a small effect, with men scoring lower on both the loving/warmth and reserved/conservative factors compared to women. Results are discussed in terms of future research with this new scale and the meaning of gender differences along these dimensions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,17]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Hill","given":"Darryl B."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Sex Research","ISSN":"0022-4499","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007]]},"page":"135-144","source":"JSTOR","title":"Differences and similarities in men's and women's sexual self-schemas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/25701752","volume":"44"},

Methods Men with mild IDs (n = 35) were asked to complete a measure of general empathy and a measure of specific victim empathy. All participants completed the victim empathy measure in relation to a hypothetical victim of a sexual offence, and a non-sexual crime, while additionally, men with a history of sexual offending were asked to complete this measure in relation to their own most recent victim. Results Men with a history of sexual offending had significantly lower general empathy, and specific victim empathy towards an unknown sexual offence victim, than men with no known history of illegal behaviour. Men with a history of sexual offending had significantly lower victim empathy for their own victim than for an unknown sexual offence victim. Victim empathy towards an unknown victim of a non-sexual crime did not differ significantly between the two groups.

  {"id":"hofer2010","abstract":"Research has shown that an individual’s implicit power motive relates to 2 types of behavioral clusters: either prosocial, socially appropriate behaviors or profligate, impulsive behaviors. The present study examined the relationship between individuals’ implicit power motives and their tendency to engage in sexual activities without strong emotional ties (i.e., sociosexuality). For men, but not for women, this relationship was hypothesized to be moderated by an implicit disposition for responsibility. Whereas most research has been limited to Euro-American contexts, the present study examined the relationship between power motive, disposition for responsibility, and sociosexuality among participants recruited in Cameroon, China, Costa Rica, and Germany. Explicit Big Five measures of personality were controlled for. For women, only a main effect of responsibility on sociosexuality was found across cultural groups; for men, the association between power motivation and sociosexuality was moderated by responsibility, independent of cultural group. Traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness were systematically related to lower levels of sociosexuality. Effects for both implicit and explicit measures of personality suggest universality in the processes associated with more enactments of sociosexuality, confirming in part the hypothesized role of responsibility in channeling the realization of the power motive into less impulsive activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofer","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Busch","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Bond","given":"Michael Harris"},{"family":"Campos","given":"Domingo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Law","given":"Ruby"}],"container-title":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/a0020053","ISSN":"1939-1315, 0022-3514","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"language":"en","page":"380-394","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The implicit power motive and sociosexuality in men and women: pancultural effects of responsibility.","title-short":"The implicit power motive and sociosexuality in men and women","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0020053","volume":"99"},

This study explores the impact of three code-switching types on executive functions: (1)\n              alternation\n              , (2)\n              insertion\n              , and (3)\n              dense code-switching\n              or\n              congruent lexicalisation\n              . Current models hypothesise that different code-switching types challenge different aspects of the executive system because they vary in the extent and scope of language separation. Two groups of German-English bilinguals differing in dense code-switching frequency participated in a flanker task under conditions varying in degree of trial-mixing and resulting demands to conflict-monitoring. Bilinguals engaging in more dense code-switching showed inhibitory advantages in the condition requiring most conflict-monitoring. Moreover, dense code-switching frequency correlated positively with monitoring skills. This suggests that dense code-switching is a key experience shaping bilinguals’ executive functioning and highlights the importance of controlling for participants’ code-switching habits in bilingualism research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofweber","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Marinis","given":"Theodoros"},{"family":"Treffers-Daller","given":"Jeanine"}],"container-title":"Linguistic Approaches to Bilingualism","DOI":"10.1075/lab.15052.hof","ISSN":"1879-9264, 1879-9272","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,20]]},"language":"en","page":"648-668","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of dense code-switching on executive control","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/lab.15052.hof","volume":"6"},

This theorizing yields four insights into the way emotions shape moral judgment. We submit that there are two kinds of specificity in the impact of emotion upon moral judgment: domain specificity and emotion specificity. We further contend that the unique embodied aspects of an emotion, such as nonverbal expressions and physiological responses, contribute to an emotion’s impact on moral judgment. Finally, emotions play a key role in determining which issues acquire moral significance in a society over time, in a process known as moralization (Rozin, 1999).

Sexual health education for female adolescents broadens opportunities for nurses to help female adolescents adopt appropriate sexual attitudes and make appropriate decisions.\nPurpose: The purpose of this study was to understand the effect of sexual empowerment on sexual decision making in female adolescents.\nMethods: Twenty-nine female students with steady boyfriends were invited to participate in a sexual empowerment course. Course activities specifically related to sexual empowerment were audio-tape-recorded. Dialogue content was analyzed, and content provided by each study participant was reconfirmed in face-to-face interviews to understand the entire empowerment process in terms of how such may affect responses and to assess the possibility of correctly reinterpreting findings during the member check process. This study also took into consideration degrees of reliability and rigorousness.\nResults: The four themes found to underlie participant perceptions of their sexual empowerment to make sex-related decisions were as follows: (a) proactively seeking sexual knowledge, (b) reexamining relationships with boyfriends, (c) the right to say ‘‘no’’ and to engage in self-protection, and (d) the need to change sexual attitudes and behaviors.\nConclusions and Implications for Practice: Using the peer group intervention in sexual empowerment may positively impact sexual health decision making in adolescent girls.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent, has presented a constant challenge for the provision of such therapy as it has demonstrated the ability to become resistant to successive highly active agents chosen for first-line treatment. Acquisition of plasmids from other bacteria and long-term use of a single agent has selected both single step high-level and low-level resistance due to multiple mutations. While therapeutic failure of the current recommended agents cefixime and ceftriaxone begins to emerge, choice of alternative therapies is limited. Guidelines for therapy will be dependent on surveillance programs but individual patient management will require a viable organism to detect emerging resistance. Advances in molecular detection, while advantageous for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, fail to provide a viable organism, posing even greater challenges for the definition of treatment failure, and appropriate end points for test of cure.

We begin by describing psychological, social, and biological correlates of the dominance behavioral system (DBS). Extensive research suggests that externalizing disorders, mania-proneness, and narcissistic traits are related to heightened dominance motivation and behaviors. Mania and narcissistic traits also appear related to inflated self-perceptions of power. Anxiety and depression are related to subordination and submissiveness, as well as a desire to avoid subordination. Models of the DBS have received support from research with humans and animals; from self-report, observational, and biological methods; and using naturalistic and experimental paradigms. Limitations of available research include the relative lack of longitudinal studies using multiple measures of the DBS and the absence of relevant studies using diagnosed samples to study narcissistic personality disorder and bipolar disorder. We provide suggestions for future research on the DBS and psychopathology, including investigations of whether the DBS can be used to differentiate specific disorder outcomes; the need for more sophisticated biological research; and the value of longitudinal dynamical research. Implications of using the DBS as a tool in clinical assessment and treatment are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Sheri L."},{"family":"Leedom","given":"Liane J."},{"family":"Muhtadie","given":"Luma"}],"container-title":"Psychological Bulletin","container-title-short":"Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1037/a0027503","ISSN":"0033-2909","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7]]},"page":"692-743","PMCID":"PMC3383914","PMID":"22506751","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The dominance behavioral system and psychopathology: evidence from self-report, observational, and biological studies","title-short":"The dominance behavioral system and psychopathology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383914/","volume":"138"},

  {"id":"johnson2014","abstract":"Schnall, Benton, and Harvey (2008) hypothesized that physical cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments. In support of this idea, they found that individuals make less severe judgments when they are primed with the concept of cleanliness (Exp. 1) and when they wash their hands after experiencing disgust (Exp. 2). We conducted direct replications of both studies using materials supplied by the original authors. We did not find evidence that physical cleanliness reduced the severity of moral judgments using samples sizes that provided over .99 power to detect the original effect sizes. Our estimates of the overall effect size were much smaller than estimates from Experiment 1 (original d = À0.60, 95% CI [À1.23, 0.04], N = 40; replication d = À0.01, 95% CI [À0.28, 0.26], N = 208) and Experiment 2 (original d = À0.85, 95% CI [À1.47, À0.22], N = 43; replication d = 0.01, 95% CI [À.34, 0.36], N = 126).

There have been a number of attempts to describe the nature of these beliefs and to develop ways of measuring them but in the absence of any integrating theory. It is our belief that an understanding of the cognitive processes underlying the initiation, maintenance, and justification of sexual offending is a vital prerequisite to the development of successful treatment programs. The present paper proposes the use of a social cognition framework in considering cognitive processes that may be important contributing factors in the propensity of some men to commit sexual offenses. Pertinent research in the social cognition domain, covering information processing, mental control, and the impact of affective and motivational factors on cognitive processes, is described and related to the sexual offending literature.

Altruistic individuals may benefit by eliciting altruism from observers, rather than (as in direct reciprocity) from the recipient of the aid they provide. Here, we point out that indirect reciprocity need not always favour cooperation; by contrast, it may support spiteful behaviour, which is costly for the both actor and recipient.

Dark personality traits accounted for almost six times more variance in individual differences in sinning than the moral foundations which suggests that it is personality rather than morality that is responsible for sinning behaviors. While sadism and spitefulness accounted for unique and significantly more variance, this was a small and specialized amount. We replicated effects suggesting men are more strongly embodied by dark personality traits and behaviors than women are, and women are more morally virtuous than men are, but showed these sex differences were a function of dark personality traits—in particular—and moral foundations.

In two cross-sectional, self-report studies (N = 942), we examined the relationships between fundamental social motives and dark personality traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, sadism, spitefulness, and Machiavellianism) and examined the role of childhood socio-ecological conditions (Study 2 only). For example, we found that Machiavellianism and psychopathy were negatively associated with motivations that involved developing and maintaining good relationships with others. Sex diﬀerences in the darker aspects of personality were a function of, at least in part, fundamental social motives such as the desire for status. Fundamental social motives mediated the associations that childhood socio-ecological conditions had with the darker aspects of personality. Our results showed how motivational tendencies in men and women may provide insights into alternative life history strategies reﬂected in dark personality traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonason","given":"Peter K."},{"family":"Zeigler-Hill","given":"Virgil"}],"container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2018.05.031","ISSN":"01918869","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"language":"en","page":"98-107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The fundamental social motives that characterize dark personality traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019188691830285X","volume":"132"},

Recently Ward, Keenan, and Hudson have proposed that sexual offenders may suffer from a deficit in their ability to understand and attribute mental states to others.

We used comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) 3.0 to systematically synthesize and analyze the 42 effect sizes from 16 studies (total N = 7,233).\nRESULTS: Attachment anxiety has a small effect on having multiple partners (Fisher's Z = .09, 95% CI [0.021, 0.154]; I² = 80.4%) and engaging in condomless sex (Fisher's Z = .09, 95% CI [.006, 0.175]; I² = 82.5%), whereas attachment avoidance has a small effect on having multiple partners (Fisher's Z = .06, 95% CI [0.019, 0.109]; I² = 57.6%) but no effect on engaging in condomless sex (Fisher's Z = .05, 95% CI [-0.024, 0.117]; I2 = 73.9%). Furthermore, average age of participants in a study (z = 3.31, β = .01, p = .001) and type of risk population (z = 3.03, β = .12, p = .002) were found to be significant moderators.\nCONCLUSIONS: Insecure attachment styles are related to risky sexual behaviors and the correlation between attachment anxiety and having multiple partners is stronger as the average age of participant increases and when the study population is specifically an at-risk population.

  {"id":"kimbrough2012","abstract":"Spiteful, antisocial behavior may undermine the moral and institutional fabric of society, producing disorder, fear, and mistrust. Previous research demonstrates the willingness of individuals to harm others, but little is understood about how far people are willing to go in being spiteful (relative to how far they could have gone) or their consistency in spitefulness across repeated trials. Our experiment is the first to provide individuals with repeated opportunities to spitefully harm anonymous others when the decision entails zero cost to the spiter and cannot be observed as such by the object of spite. This method reveals that the majority of individuals exhibit consistent (non-)spitefulness over time and that the distribution of spitefulness is bipolar: when choosing whether to be spiteful, most individuals either avoid spite altogether or impose the maximum possible harm on their unwitting victims.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kimbrough","given":"Erik O."},{"family":"Reiss","given":"J.

However, the relationship between dark personality traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, sadism, and spitefulness) and PIU has yet to be investigated. Consequently, the objectives of this study were to investigate the relationships of dark traits with speciﬁc online activities (i.e., social media, gaming, gambling, shopping, and sex) and PIU. Methods: A total of 772 university students completed a self-report survey, including the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen Scale, Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, Spitefulness Scale, and an adapted version of the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results: Hierarchical regression analysis and a multiple mediation model indicated that being male was positively associated with higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling, and negatively associated with social media and online shopping. Narcissism was related to higher social media use; Machiavellianism was related to higher online gaming, online sex, and online gambling; sadism was related to online sex; and spitefulness was associated with online sex, online gambling, and online shopping. Finally, Machiavellianism and spitefulness were directly and indirectly associated with PIU via online gambling, online gaming, and online shopping, and narcissism was indirectly associated with PIU through social media use. Discussion: Findings of this preliminary study show that individuals high in dark personality traits may be more vulnerable in developing problematic online use and that further research is warranted to examine the associations of dark personality traits with speciﬁc types of problematic online activities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kircaburun","given":"Kagan"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Mark D."}],"container-title":"Journal of Behavioral Addictions","container-title-short":"Journal of Behavioral Addictions","DOI":"10.1556/2006.7.2018.109","ISSN":"2062-5871, 2063-5303","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,12]]},"language":"en","page":"993-1003","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The dark side of internet: preliminary evidence for the associations of dark personality traits with specific online activities and problematic internet use","title-short":"The dark side of internet","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.akademiai.com/doi/10.1556/2006.7.2018.109","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"kornell2009","abstract":"It has long been assumed that metacognition—thinking about one's own thoughts—is a uniquely human ability. Yet a decade of research suggests that, like humans, other animals can differentiate between what they know and what they do not know. They opt out of difficult trials; they avoid tests they are unlikely to answer correctly; and they make riskier “bets” when their memories are accurate than they do when their memories are inaccurate. These feats are simultaneously impressive and, by human standards, somewhat limited; new evidence suggests, however, that animals can generalize metacognitive judgments to new contexts and seek more information when they are unsure. Metacognition is intriguing, in part, because of parallels with self-reflection and conscious awareness. Consciousness appears to be consistent with, but not required by, the abilities animals have demonstrated thus far.","author":[{"family":"Kornell","given":"Nate"}],"container-title":"Current Directions in Psychological Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01597.x","ISSN":"0963-7214","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"eng","page":"11–15","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Metacognition in humans and animals","type":"article-journal","volume":"18"},

In eight experiments, we examined the link between immorality and self-dehumanization, testing both (a) the causal role of immoral behavior on self-dehumanization and (b) the causal role of self-dehumanization on immoral behavior. Studies 1a to 1d showed that people feel less human after behaving immorally and that these effects were not driven by having a negative experience but were unique to experiences of immorality (Study 1d). Studies 2a to 2c showed that self-dehumanization can lead to immoral and antisocial behavior. Study 3 highlighted how self-dehumanization can sometimes produce downward spirals of immorality, demonstrating initial unethical behavior leading to self-dehumanization, which in turn promotes continued dishonesty. These results demonstrate a clear relationship between self-dehumanization and unethical behavior, and they extend previous theorizing on dehumanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kouchaki","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Dobson","given":"Kyle S.

Here, I show that the distinctions among them arise from the ways in which fitness is partitioned: none can be drawn when the fitness consequences of an action are wholly aggregated, but they manifest clearly when the consequences are partitioned into primary and secondary (neighbourhood) effects. I argue that the primary interaction is the principal source of adaptive design, because (i) it is this interaction that determines the fit of an adaptation and (ii) it is the actor and primary recipients whom an adaptation foremost affects. The categories of social action are thus instrumental to any account of evolved function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Krupp","given":"D.

  {"id":"landy","abstract":"The role of emotion in moral judgment is currently a topic of much debate in moral psychology. One specific claim made by many researchers is that irrelevant feelings of disgust can amplify the severity of moral condemnation. Numerous researchers have found this effect, but there have also been several published failures to replicate it. Clarifying this issue would inform important theoretical debates among rival accounts of moral judgment. We metaanalyzed all available studies—published and unpublished—in which incidental disgust was manipulated prior to or concurrent with a moral judgment task (k = 50). We found evidence for a small amplification effect of disgust (d = 0.11), which is strongest for gustatory/olfactory modes of disgust induction. However, there is also some suggestion of publication bias in this literature, and when this is accounted for, the effect disappears entirely (d = −0.01). Moreover, prevalent confounds mean that the effect size that we estimate is best interpreted as an upper bound on the size of the amplification effect. On the basis of the results of this meta-analysis, we argue against strong claims about the causal role of affect in moral judgment and suggest a need for new, more rigorous research on this topic.","author":[{"family":"Landy","given":"Justin F"},{"family":"Goodwin","given":"Geoffrey P"}],"language":"en","page":"19","source":"Zotero","title":"Does incidental disgust amplify moral judgment?

We first consider the historic role of Sigmund Freud and note that a broad scientific interest in deviant sexual behavior was well established by 1900. In the early to mid-20th century, two psychologies were prominent in the development of behavioral approaches, those of John B. Watson and Alfred Kinsey. Behavior therapy for a variety of problems emerged in the 1950s and soon found application to deviant sexuality. The development of penile plethysmography helped to focus interest on deviant sexual preference and behavior. While nonbehavioral approaches to sexual offenders paralleled these developments, a combination of behavioral and cognitive behavioral treatments began to emerge in the late 1960s which ultimately developed into the approaches more commonly seen today.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Laws","given":"D.

  {"id":"layder2009","abstract":"What makes an intimate relationship truly satisfying? Is there too much pressure on intimacy to succeed in the modern world? Do we expect too much from partners? This book tackles such questions by examining the social and psychological forces at play in close relationships, and argues that the forms of modern couple intimacy are more varied and complex than recent accounts would suggest. In this respect the book reveals how the combined influence of individual, interpersonal and wider social factors create variation in self-disclosure, intimacy games and relationship habits. By highlighting the way power and control influence the fate of personal relationships Derek Layder identifies the key ingredients of optimal intimacy as well as those that work to undermine or destroy it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Layder","given":"Derek"}],"event-place":"Basingstoke","ISBN":"978-0-230-24514-3 978-1-349-36820-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 497766966","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","publisher-place":"Basingstoke","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Intimacy and power: the dynamics of personal relationships in modern society","title-short":"Intimacy and power","type":"book","URL":"http://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=555522"},

  {"id":"leslie2006","abstract":"The concept of acting intentionally is an important nexus where theory of mind and moral judgment meet. Preschool children's judgments of intentional action show a valence-driven asymmetry. Children say that a foreseen but disavowed side effect is brought about “on purpose” when the side effect itself is morally bad, but not when it is morally good. This is the first demonstration in preschoolers that moral judgment influences judgments of whether something was done on purpose (as opposed to judgments of purpose influencing moral judgment). Judgments of intentionality are usually assumed to be purely factual. That these judgments are sometimes partly normative—even in preschoolers—challenges current understanding. Young children's judgments regarding foreseen side effects depend on whether the children process the idea that the character does not care about the side effect. As soon as preschoolers effectively process the theory-of-mind concept “not care that P,” children show the side-effect effect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Leslie","given":"Alan M."},{"family":"Knobe","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Adam"}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01722.x","ISSN":"0956-7976","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"421-427","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Acting intentionally and the side-effect effect: theory of mind and moral judgment","title-short":"Acting intentionally and the side-effect effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01722.x","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"levin2014","abstract":"Public goods and common-pool resources are fundamental features of biological and social systems, and pose core challenges in achieving sustainability; for such situations, the immediate interests of individuals and the societies in which they are embedded are in potential conflict, involving game-theoretic considerations whose resolution need not serve the collective good. Evolution has often confronted such dilemmas—e.g., in bacterial biofilms—in the challenges of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups; there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions that maintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon,” and hence in how groups of individuals form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Levin","given":"Simon A."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1400830111","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"Supplement 3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,22]]},"language":"en","page":"10838-10845","PMID":"25024192","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Public goods in relation to competition, cooperation, and spite","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_3/10838","volume":"111"},

The weight on the opponent's income is private information and varies in the population, depending, moreover, on what the opponent's coefficient is believed to be. Using results of ultimatum experiments and the final round of a centipede experiment, we are able to pin down relatively accurately what the distribution of altruism (and spite) in the population is. This distribution is then used with a reasonable degree of success to explain the results of the earlier rounds of centipede and the results of some public goods contribution games. In addition, we show that in a market game where the theory of selfish players does quite well, the theory of altruism makes exactly the same predictions as the theory of selfish players.Journal of Economic LiteratureClassification Numbers: C70, C72, D90, D92.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Levine","given":"David K."}],"container-title":"Review of Economic Dynamics","container-title-short":"Review of Economic Dynamics","DOI":"10.1006/redy.1998.0023","ISSN":"1094-2025","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"593-622","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modeling altruism and spitefulness in experiments","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094202598900230","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"lewis2002","abstract":"The dominance concept as it is currently defined and applied in animal behavior is problematic. What has been traditionally considered dominance is actually a combination of dominance in the strict sense and power based upon other sources. Rather than working within the current paradigm, I propose a conceptual revision founded upon the more inclusive concept of power. Power is a phenomenon where a dyadic relationship is asymmetrical (Simon 1953) and can be divided into two types: dominance and leverage. Dominance is power based upon the ability to use force. Leverage is power based upon a resource that cannot be taken by force. Four characteristics of power are used in sociology (base, means, amount, and scope) that facilitate both the expansion of the power concept beyond traditional dominance and the application of these theoretical ideas in empirical studies. This cross‐disciplinary approach to power allows a wide range of behaviors to be considered as critical while at the same time it focuses the attention of researchers to the aspects of power that differ among dyads, classes, and species. Power is not simply a linear combination of dominance and leverage, and more research is needed before the exact nature of this relationship can be clarified. By considering dominance as one form of power, this framework fosters a more complete understanding of power dynamics and their effects on animal societies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lewis","given":"Rebecca J"}],"container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","DOI":"10.1086/343899","ISSN":"0033-5770","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,6,1]]},"page":"149-164","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk (Atypon)","title":"Beyond dominance: the importance of leverage","title-short":"Beyond dominance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/343899","volume":"77"},

  {"id":"locey2011","abstract":"Laboratory studies of choice and decision making among real monetary rewards typically use smaller real rewards than those common in real life. When laboratory rewards are large, they are almost always hypothetical. In applying laboratory results meaningfully to real-life situations, it is important to know the extent to which choices among hypothetical rewards correspond to choices among real rewards and whether variation of the magnitude of hypothetical rewards affects behavior in meaningful ways. The present study compared real and hypothetical monetary rewards in two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants played a temporal discounting game that incorporates the logic of a repeated prisoner’s-dilemma (PD) type game versus tit-for-tat; choice of one alternative (“defection” in PD terminology) resulted in a small-immediate reward; choice of the other alternative (“cooperation” in PD terminology) resulted in a larger reward delayed until the following trial. The larger-delayed reward was greater for half of the groups than for the other half. Rewards also differed in type across groups: multiples of real nickels, hypothetical nickels or hypothetical hundred-dollar bills. All groups significantly increased choice of the larger delayed reward over the 40 trials of the experiment. Over the last 10 trials, cooperation was significantly higher when the difference between larger and smaller hypothetical rewards was greater. Reward type (real or hypothetical) made no significant difference in cooperation. In Experiment 2, real and hypothetical rewards were compared in social discounting – the decrease in value to the giver of a reward as social distance increases to the receiver of the reward. Social discount rates were well described by a hyperbolic function. Discounting rates for real and hypothetical rewards did not significantly differ. These results add to the evidence that results of experiments with hypothetical rewards validly apply in everyday life.","author":[{"family":"Locey","given":"Matthew"},{"literal":"Bryan Jones"},{"family":"Rachlin","given":"Howard"}],"container-title":"Judgement and Decision-Making","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"page":"552-564","title":"Real and hypothetical rewards","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

More recently, theory and research have attempted to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory roles by integrating them.

  {"id":"marcus2014","abstract":"Spite is an understudied construct that has been virtually ignored within the personality, social, and clinical psychology literatures. This study introduces a self-report Spitefulness Scale to assess individual differences in spitefulness. The scale was initially tested on a large sample of 946 college students and cross-validated on a national sample of 297 adults. The scale was internally consistent in both samples. Factor analysis supported a 1-factor solution for the initial pool of 31 items. Item response theory analysis was used to identify the best performing of the original 31 items in the university sample and reduce the scale to 17 items. Tests of measurement invariance indicated that the items functioned similarly across both university and national samples, across both men and women, and across both ethnic majority and minority groups. Men reported higher levels of spitefulness than women, younger people were more spiteful than older people, and ethnic minority members reported higher levels of spitefulness than ethnic majority members. Across both samples, spitefulness was positively associated with aggression, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, narcissism, and guilt-free shame, and negatively correlated with selfesteem, guilt-proneness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Ideally, this Spitefulness Scale will be able to predict behavior in both laboratory settings (e.g., ultimatum games, aggression paradigms) and everyday life, contribute to the diagnosis of personality disorders and oppositional defiant disorder, and encourage further study of this neglected, often destructive, trait.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Marcus","given":"David K."},{"family":"Zeigler-Hill","given":"Virgil"},{"family":"Mercer","given":"Sterett H."},{"family":"Norris","given":"Alyssa L."}],"container-title":"Psychological Assessment","container-title-short":"Psychological Assessment","DOI":"10.1037/a0036039","ISSN":"1939-134X, 1040-3590","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"563-574","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The psychology of spite and the measurement of spitefulness.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0036039","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"marcus2016","abstract":"Despite the ubiquity of spite and its potential consequences, spitefulness, as an individual difference variable, has received far less attention in the psychology research literature than other dark personality traits such as narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, or sadism. The first personality scale designed to assess trait spitefulness was only developed recently (Marcus, Zeigler-Hill, Mercer, & Norris, 2014). There is also no standard definition of spitefulness. Spite can be broadly defined to include any vindictive or mean-spirited actions. Alternatively, a narrower definition includes the requirement that spiteful acts involve some degree of self-harm (e.g., “cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face”). The current chapter focuses on this narrow definition, both because it distinguishes spite from other related acts of aggression and because it emphasizes the apparently irrational and paradoxical nature of spitefulness.

We show that smaller societies are less generous in the Dictator Game but no less prone to 2PP in the Ultimatum Game. We might assume people everywhere would be more willing to punish someone who hurt them directly (2PP) than someone who hurt an anonymous third person (3PP). While this is true of small societies, people in large societies are actually more likely to engage in 3PP than 2PP. Strong reciprocity, including generous offers and 3PP, exists mostly in large, complex societies that face numerous challenging collective action problems. We argue that ‘spiteful’ 2PP, motivated by the basic emotion of anger, is more universal than 3PP and sufficient to explain the origins of human cooperation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Marlowe","given":"Frank W."},{"family":"Berbesque","given":"J.

Emotion and cognition are known to interact during human decision processes. In this study we focus on a specific kind of cognition, namely metacognition. Our experiment induces a negative emotion, worry, during a perceptual task. In a numerosity task subjects have to make a two alternative forced choice and then reveal their confidence in this decision. We measure metacognition in terms of discrimination and calibration abilities. Our results show that metacognition, but not choice, is affected by the level of worry anticipated before the decision. Under worry individuals tend to have better metacognition in terms of the two measures. Furthermore understanding the formation of confidence is better explained with taking into account the level of worry in the model.

  {"id":"mcauliffe2019","abstract":"The past few decades of moral psychology research have yielded empirical anomalies for rationalist theories of moral judgments. An increasing number of psychologists and philosophers argue that these anomalies are explained well by sentimentalism, the thesis that the presence of an emotion is necessary for the formation of a sincere moral judgment. The present review reveals that while emotions and moral judgments indeed often co-occur, there is scant evidence that emotions directly cause or constitute moral judgments. Research on disgust, anger, sympathy, and guilt indicates that people only reliably experience emotions when judging conduct that is relevant to the welfare of the self and valued others. Moreover, many recent studies have either failed to replicate or exposed crucial confounds in the most cited evidence in support of sentimentalism. Moral psychologists should jettison sentimentalism, and focus instead on how considerations of harm and welfare—the core concepts of rationalist theories— interact with empirical beliefs to shape moral judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McAuliffe","given":"William H.

Previous research suggests that deontological moral judgments are often underpinned by affective reactions and utilitarian moral judgments by deliberative thinking. Separately, research on the psychology of aging has shown that affect plays a more prominent role in the judgments and decision making of older (vs. younger) adults. Yet age remains a largely overlooked factor in moral judgment research. Here, we therefore investigated whether older adults would make more deontological judgments on the basis of experiencing different affective reactions to moral dilemmas as compared with younger adults. Results from 2 experiments indicated that older adults made significantly more deontological moral judgments. Mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between age and making more deontological moral judgments is partly explained by older adults exhibiting significantly more negative affective reactions and having more morally idealistic beliefs as compared with younger adults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McNair","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Okan","given":"Yasmina"},{"family":"Hadjichristidis","given":"Constantinos"},{"family":"Bruin","given":"Wändi Bruine","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"container-title":"Journal of Behavioral Decision Making","container-title-short":"J Behav Dec Making","DOI":"10.1002/bdm.2086","ISSN":"08943257","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","page":"47-60","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Age differences in moral judgment: older adults are more deontological than younger adults","title-short":"Age differences in moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/bdm.2086","volume":"32"},

In the 1980s and ’90s, the field shifted as researchers increasingly used sociocultural theories, particularly the work of L. S. Vygotsky, to frame investigations of literacy. This article provides a brief review of schema theory as situated in literacy studies. The authors review various conceptions of schema theory to consider how recent social and cultural perspectives might prompt reconsideration of schemas as transactional and embodied constructs. Concomitantly, they explore how earlier conceptions of schema theory may assist researchers in their articulation of concepts such as ideal and material tools and the role of activity in Vygotsky’s work.

The final 48-item dominance-submissiveness questionnaire, which was balanced for response bias, had high internal consistency (Kuder-Richardson formula 20 coefficient was equal to .95). It was independent of social desirability (correlated .08 with the Crowne and Marlowe social desirability scale). As the scale also satisfied the requirements of low correlations with measures of trait pleasure ( r = .14) and arousability ( r = -.10), it can thus be used with these two measures for a three-dimensional characterization of temperament.

  {"id":"mercer2013","abstract":"<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3><p>Sexual behaviour and relationships are key components of wellbeing and are affected by social norms, attitudes, and health. We present data on sexual behaviours and attitudes in Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) from the three National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal).</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We used a multistage, clustered, and stratified probability sample design. Within each of the 1727 sampled postcode sectors for Natsal-3, 30 or 36 addresses were randomly selected and then assigned to interviewers. To oversample individuals aged 16–34 years, we randomly allocated addresses to either the core sample (in which individuals aged 16–74 years were eligible) or the boost sample (in which only individuals aged 16–34 years were eligible). Interviewers visited all sampled addresses between Sept 6, 2010, and Aug 31, 2012, and randomly selected one eligible individual from each household to be invited to participate. Participants completed the survey in their own homes through computer-assisted face-to-face interviews and self-interview. We analysed data from this survey, weighted to account for unequal selection probabilities and non-response to correct for differences in sex, age group, and region according to 2011 Census figures. We then compared data from participants aged 16–44 years from Natsal-1 (1990–91), Natsal-2 (1999–2001), and Natsal-3.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>Interviews were completed with 15 162 participants (6293 men, 8869 women) from 26 274 eligible addresses (57·7%). 82·1% (95% CI 81·0–83·1%) of men and 77·7% (76·7–78·7%) of women reported at least one sexual partner of the opposite sex in the past year. The proportion generally decreased with age, as did the range of sexual practices with partners of the opposite sex, especially in women. The increased sexual activity and diversity reported in Natsal-2 in individuals aged 16–44 years when compared with Natsal-1 has generally been sustained in Natsal-3, but in men has generally not risen further. However, in women, the number of male sexual partners over the lifetime (age-adjusted odds ratio 1·18, 95% CI 1·08–1·28), proportion reporting ever having had a sexual experience with genital contact with another woman (1·69, 1·43–2·00), and proportion reporting at least one female sexual partner in the past 5 years (2·00, 1·59–2·51) increased in Natsal-3 compared with Natsal-2. While reported number of occasions of heterosexual intercourse in the past 4 weeks had reduced since Natsal-2, we recorded an expansion of heterosexual repertoires—particularly in oral and anal sex—over time. Acceptance of same-sex partnerships and intolerance of non-exclusivity in marriage increased in men and women in Natsal-3.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Sexual lifestyles in Britain have changed substantially in the past 60 years, with changes in behaviour seeming greater in women than men. The continuation of sexual activity into later life—albeit reduced in range and frequency—emphasises that attention to sexual health and wellbeing is needed throughout the life course.</p><h3>Funding</h3><p>Grants from the UK Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, with support from the Economic and Social Research Council and the Department of Health.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Mercer","given":"Catherine H."},{"family":"Tanton","given":"Clare"},{"family":"Prah","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Erens","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Sonnenberg","given":"Pam"},{"family":"Clifton","given":"Soazig"},{"family":"Macdowall","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Lewis","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Field","given":"Nigel"},{"family":"Datta","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Copas","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Phelps","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Wellings","given":"Kaye"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Anne M."}],"container-title":"The Lancet","container-title-short":"The Lancet","DOI":"10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62035-8","ISSN":"0140-6736, 1474-547X","issue":"9907","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,30]]},"language":"English","page":"1781-1794","PMID":"24286784","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"www.thelancet.com","title":"Changes in sexual attitudes and lifestyles in britain through the life course and over time: findings from the national surveys of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (natsal)","title-short":"Changes in sexual attitudes and lifestyles in britain through the life course and over time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62035-8/abstract","volume":"382"},

We demonstrate that similar judgments arise when people consider damage to owned objects.

Participants judged this unacceptable when it required violating another’s ownership rights, but not otherwise. They also judged that sacrificing another’s object was less acceptable as a means than as a side-effect; judgments did not depend on whether property damage involved personal force. These findings inform theories of moral decision-making. They show that utilitarian judgment can be decreased without physical harm to persons, and without personal force.

Here, we propose a cognitive neuroscience view of how cultural and context-dependent knowledge, semantic social knowledge and motivational states can be integrated to explain complex aspects of human moral cognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Moll","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Zahn","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Oliveira-Souza","given":"Ricardo","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Krueger","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Grafman","given":"Jordan"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Neurosci","DOI":"10.1038/nrn1768","ISSN":"1471-003X, 1471-0048","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,10]]},"language":"en","page":"799-809","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The neural basis of human moral cognition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1768","volume":"6"},

Based on self-affirmation theory, we predicted that providing an opportunity to self-affirm decreases the tendency to morally condemn harmless sexual taboos. In Experiment 1, we found evidence that self-affirmation decreases the moral condemnation of harmless sexual taboos and ruled out that this was due to a decrease in how disgusting participants considered taboo acts. In Experiment 2, we replicated this effect and demonstrated the mediating role of self-directed threat emotions. These results demonstrate that the tendency to morally condemn harmless sexual taboos arises in part from the need to protect self-integrity. We discuss the implications for the role of the self and emotions in moral judgements and interventions aimed at increasing the acceptability of harmless sexual taboos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Mooijman","given":"Marlon"},{"family":"Dijk","given":"Wilco W.

  {"id":"moore2007","abstract":"Since HIV in Africa is spread primarily through unprotected sex, safe sex practices such as condom use can reduce HIV spread significantly. Nevertheless, because sexual behavior involves complex dynamics, condom use is not an easy option for many people in Africa despite years of condom distribution intervention. In fact, the complex nature of sexuality complicates efforts to combat HIV spread and limits the effectiveness of many prevention efforts. This paper uses theoretical explanations—social representation theory, situated rationality theory, and social action theory—to examine the patterns of sexual risk behavior and the underlying reasons and rationalization among people living with HIV/AIDS in Lomé, Togo. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 151 people living with HIV/AIDS, recruited from 3 HIV/AIDS centers. The results of this in-depth study suggest that although people living with HIV/AIDS may be aware of the risk of infecting their sexual partners, they deliberately ignore the risk because other considerations, such as wanting a baby, take precedence. Consequently, condom access is inadequate to change risky sexual behavior that spreads HIV. It must be supplemented with adequate empowerment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Ami R."},{"family":"Oppong","given":"Joseph"}],"collection-title":"HIV/AIDS, gender, agency and empowerment issues in Africa","container-title":"Social Science & Medicine","container-title-short":"Social Science & Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.10.004","ISSN":"0277-9536","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1057-1066","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Sexual risk behavior among people living with HIV/AIDS in togo","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953606005156","volume":"64"},

Abstract Humans and other animals constantly evaluate their decisions in order to learn and behave adaptively. Experimentally, such evaluation processes are accessed using metacognitive reports made after decisions, typically using verbally formulated confidence scales. When subjects report high confidence, it reflects a high certainty of being correct, but a low confidence might signify either low certainty about the outcome, or a high certainty of being incorrect. Hence, metacognitive reports might reflect not only different levels of decision certainty, but also two certainty directions (certainty of being correct and certainty of being incorrect). It is important to test if such bi-directional processing can be measured because, for decision-making under uncertainty, information about being incorrect is as important as information about being correct for guidance of subsequent behavior. We were able to capture implicit bi-directional certainty readouts by asking subjects to bet money on their perceptual decision accuracy using a six-grade wager scale (post-decision wagering, PDW). To isolate trial-specific aspects of metacognitive judgments, we used pre-decision wagering (wagering before the perceptual decision) to subtract, from PDW trials, influences resulting from non-trial-specific assessment of expected difficulty and psychological biases. This novel design allowed independent quantification of certainty of being correct and certainty of being incorrect, showing that subjects were able to read out certainty in a bi-directional manner. Certainty readouts about being incorrect were particularly associated with metacognitive sensitivity exceeding perceptual sensitivity (i.e. meta-d' > d'), suggesting that such enhanced metacognitive efficiency is driven by information about incorrect decisions. Readouts of certainty in both directions increased on easier trials, and both certainty directions were also associated with faster metacognitive reaction times, indicating that certainty of being incorrect was not confounded with low certainty. Finally, both readouts influenced the amount of money subjects earned through PDW, suggesting that bi-directional readouts are important for planning future actions when feedback about previous decisions is unavailable.

  {"id":"morgan2003","abstract":"We study auctions where bidders have independent private values but attach a disutility to the surplus of rivals, and derive symmetric equilibria for first-price, second-price, English, and Dutch auctions. We find that equilibrium bidding is more aggressive than standard predictions. Indeed, in second-price auctions it is optimal to bid above one's valuation; that is, bidding \"frenzies\" can arise in equilibrium. Further, revenue equivalence between second-price and first-price auctions breaks down, with second-price outperforming first-price. We also find that strategic equivalence between second-price and English auctions no longer holds, although they remain revenue equivalent. We conclude that spiteful bidding rationalizes anomalies observed in laboratory experiments across the four auction forms better than the leading alternatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Morgan","given":"John"},{"family":"Steiglitz","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Reis","given":"George"}],"container-title":"Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy","DOI":"10.2202/1538-0645.1102","ISSN":"1538-0645","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"source":"DeGruyter","title":"The spite motive and equilibrium behavior in auctions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/bejeap.2002.2.issue-1/bejeap.2003.2.1.1102/bejeap.2003.2.1.1102.xml","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"nichols2002","abstract":"There is a large tradition of work in moral psychology that explores the capacity for moral judgment by focusing on the basic capacity to distinguish moral violations (e.g. hitting another person) from conventional violations (e.g. playing with your food). However, only recently have there been attempts to characterize the cognitive mechanisms underlying moral judgment (e.g. Cognition 57 (1995) 1; Ethics 103 (1993) 337). Recent evidence indicates that affect plays a crucial role in mediating the capacity to draw the moral/conventional distinction. However, the prevailing account of the role of affect in moral judgment is problematic. This paper argues that the capacity to draw the moral/conventional distinction depends on both a body of information about which actions are prohibited (a Normative Theory) and an affective mechanism. This account leads to the prediction that other normative prohibitions that are connected to an affective mechanism might be treated as non-conventional. An experiment is presented that indicates that “disgust” violations (e.g. spitting at the table), are distinguished from conventional violations along the same dimensions as moral violations. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Research thus far has provided only limited understanding of agerelated changes within the moral domain. That research indicates that there are continuities and discontinuities across ages in moral judgments. The aims of the research presented here were to examine moral judgments in childhood and adolescence, taking into account applications of moral judgments in contexts and the coordination of different considerations in evaluations and decisions. Participants were 167 children and adolescents drawn from two regions of the United States, from diverse ethnic and SES backgrounds, distributed across four age groups from 8 to 17 years. Moral judgments were assessed through interviews around issues of direct harm (hitting), indirect harm (returning dropped money), and helping. Each situation was presented within three conditions: unconflicted situations; situations of conflict with needs of self; and conflicts with needs of another. Situations varied in terms of characteristics of the person who was the object of moral decisions: a generic other, vulnerable other, or antagonistic other. Participants made two types of judgments: whether the action was right or wrong; and whether the actor would have a right to engage in the action if that was the actor’s choice. Justifications were elicited for judgments. Cross-age continuities in moral judgments were observed in judgments of acts as wrong in the unconflicted contexts. In contrast, a U-shaped age-related pattern was revealed in judgments of acts as well as the right to engage in acts in the conflicted situations with 8- and 16-year-olds judging acts as wrong and 10- to 14-year-olds more likely to judge acts as right and the actor as having a right to engage in the action. This U-shaped pattern was accompanied by three age-related levels in the coordination of moral and nonmoral elements of situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Nucci","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Turiel","given":"Elliot"},{"family":"Roded","given":"Alona D."}],"container-title":"Human Development","container-title-short":"Human Development","DOI":"10.1159/000484067","ISSN":"0018-716X, 1423-0054","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","page":"279-341","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Continuities and discontinuities in the development of moral judgments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/484067","volume":"60"},

The dimension of implicit, in-process normativity complements the dimension of explicit, rule-following normativity. The second part of the paper provides an empirical illustration of a typical political practice of decision-making, taken from an analysis of actual committee meetings. This illustration serves to exemplify the processual character and the dynamics as well as the internal power relations of bindingness-production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Nullmeier","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Pritzlaff","given":"Tanja"}],"container-title":"Critical Policy Studies","DOI":"10.1080/19460171003619758","ISSN":"1946-0171","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,4,28]]},"page":"357-374","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The implicit normativity of political practices. analyzing the dynamics and power relations of committee decision-making","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19460171003619758","volume":"3"},

The analysis of 149 samples from 118 articles revealed that, overall, metacognition weakly correlated with both academic performance and intelligence, and that these relationships were moderated by the type of measurement of metacognition. Furthermore, it was found that metacognition predicted academic performance when controlling for intelligence.

  {"id":"olatunji2012","abstract":"This investigation examined the measurement properties of the Three Domains of Disgust Scale (TDDS). Principal components analysis in Study 1 (n = 206) revealed three factors of Pathogen, Sexual, and Moral Disgust that demonstrated excellent reliability, including test–retest over 12 weeks. Confirmatory factor analyses in Study 2 (n = 406) supported the three factors. Supportive evidence for the validity of the Pathogen and Sexual Disgust subscales was found in Study 1 and Study 2 with strong associations with disgust/contamination and weak associations with negative affect. However, the validity of the Moral Disgust subscale was limited. Study 3 (n = 200) showed that the TDDS subscales differentially related to personality traits. Study 4 (n = 47) provided evidence for the validity of the TDDS subscales in relation to multiple indices of disgust/contamination aversion in a select sample. Study 5 (n = 70) further highlighted limitations of the Moral Disgust subscale given the lack of a theoretically consistent association with moral attitudes. Lastly, Study 6 (n = 178) showed that responses on the Moral Disgust scale were more intense when anger was the response option compared with when disgust was the response option. The implications of these findings for the assessment of disgust are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Olatunji","given":"Bunmi O."},{"family":"Adams","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Ciesielski","given":"Bethany"},{"family":"David","given":"Bieke"},{"family":"Sarawgi","given":"Shivali"},{"family":"Broman-Fulks","given":"Joshua"}],"container-title":"Assessment","container-title-short":"Assessment","DOI":"10.1177/1073191111432881","ISSN":"1073-1911, 1552-3489","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,6]]},"language":"en","page":"205-225","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The three domains of disgust scale: factor structure, psychometric properties, and conceptual limitations","title-short":"The three domains of disgust scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1073191111432881","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"osorio2015","abstract":"Objectives This study intends to evaluate whether the belief that condoms are 100% effective in protecting against HIV infection is associated with sexual risk behaviours among youth.\nMethods A cross-sectional study was performed in representative samples of high-school students in the Philippines, El Salvador and Peru. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. Students were asked about the risk of HIV transmission if one has sex using condoms. They were also asked to indicate whether they had ever had sexual relations and whether they used a condom in their first sexual relation. The sample was composed of 8994 students, aged 13–18.\nResults One out of seven adolescents believed condoms are 100% effective (safe-sex believers). Those adolescents were 82% more likely to have had sex than those without such belief, after adjusting for confounders (OR=1.82; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.21). On the contrary, no association was found between risk perception and condom use. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses produced similar results.\nConclusions This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study conducted specifically to evaluate this phenomenon and that has used the same questionnaire and the same data collection protocol in three different developing countries from Asia, Central and South America. These results reasonably suggest that there could be an association between safe sex beliefs and sexual initiation. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand this possible association as it could influence how to better promote sexual health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Osorio","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Burgo","given":"Cristina Lopez-del"},{"family":"Ruiz-Canela","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Carlos","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Irala","given":"Jokin","dropping-particle":"de"}],"container-title":"BMJ Open","DOI":"10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007826","ISSN":"2044-6055, 2044-6055","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e007826","PMID":"25916489","publisher":"British Medical Journal Publishing Group","section":"Sexual health","source":"bmjopen.bmj.com","title":"Safe-sex belief and sexual risk behaviours among adolescents from three developing countries: a cross-sectional study","title-short":"Safe-sex belief and sexual risk behaviours among adolescents from three developing countries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e007826","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"osullivan2010","abstract":"Young adults, including college students, engage in high levels of unprotected sexual activity despite relatively high rates of HIV/STI and pregnancy-related knowledge. Little is known about the cognitive strategies that young people use to explain this inconsistency. The current study examined young people’s explanations for engaging in unprotected sexual activity in their committed relationships. A total of 63 young adults (32 women and 31 men) completed daily diaries over a 3-week period, providing a total of 1,284 daily reports tracking their condom use and non-use during intercourse. Diary collection was followed by in-depth interviews designed to explore participants’ decision-making regarding their participation in sexual intercourse unprotected against infection or unwanted pregnancy. Less than a quarter of the sample used condoms or oral contraceptives consistently. Participants primarily viewed condoms as a means of preventing pregnancy; few described disease prevention as a main motivation for their use. Analysis of the cognitions underlying explanations for condom and contraception non-use were classified as (1) general biased risk evaluation, (2) biased evidence evaluation, (3) endorsement of poor alternatives, (4) focus on spurious justifications, (5) dismissing risk, and (6) ignoring risk. Prevention interventions should incorporate methods to challenge young people to acknowledge personal risk and commit themselves to taking steps to reduce this risk.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,19]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Sullivan","given":"Lucia F."},{"family":"Udell","given":"Wadiya"},{"family":"Montrose","given":"Vernique A."},{"family":"Antoniello","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Susie"}],"container-title":"Archives of Sexual Behavior","container-title-short":"Arch Sex Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s10508-009-9493-7","ISSN":"1573-2800","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1121-1131","source":"Springer Link","title":"A cognitive analysis of college students’ explanations for engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-009-9493-7","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"parkinson2011","abstract":"Much recent research has sought to uncover the neural basis of moral judgment. However, it has remained unclear whether \"moral judgments\" are sufficiently homogenous to be studied scientifically as a unified category. We tested this assumption by using fMRI to examine the neural correlates of moral judgments within three moral areas: (physical) harm, dishonesty, and (sexual) disgust. We found that the judgment of moral wrongness was subserved by distinct neural systems for each of the different moral areas and that these differences were much more robust than differences in wrongness judgments within a moral area. Dishonest, disgusting, and harmful moral transgression recruited networks of brain regions associated with mentalizing, affective processing, and action understanding, respectively. Dorsal medial pFC was the only region activated by all scenarios judged to be morally wrong in comparison with neutral scenarios. However, this region was also activated by dishonest and harmful scenarios judged not to be morally wrong, suggestive of a domain-general role that is neither peculiar to nor predictive of moral decisions. These results suggest that moral judgment is not a wholly unified faculty in the human brain, but rather, instantiated in dissociable neural systems that are engaged differentially depending on the type of transgression being judged.","author":[{"family":"Parkinson","given":"Carolyn"},{"family":"Sinnott-Armstrong","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Koralus","given":"Philipp E."},{"family":"Mendelovici","given":"Angela"},{"family":"McGeer","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Wheatley","given":"Thalia"}],"container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Cogn Neurosci","DOI":"10.1162/jocn_a_00017","ISSN":"1530-8898","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"3162-3180","PMID":"21452951","source":"PubMed","title":"Is morality unified?

The form and function of facial displays of dominance in non-human primates are related to species-typical social interactions, and the importance of facial interpretation in primates is reflected in their neurobiology.

Regression analyses were used to evaluate several variables related to sexual risk‐taking, i.e., condom use, number of sexual partners in the last three months, and casual sex. The most consistent predictors of cautious sexual behaviors were age at first intercourse, average number of partners per year, being female and using seatbelts while driving. Safer sexual practices were not influenced by religiosity or having had a course on human sexuality or religiosity.

  {"id":"pleck1993","abstract":"The article calls attention to the impact of masculinity ideology on adolescent males' heterosexual relationships. Social-psychological research has adopted two broad theoretical approaches to the male gender role: trait perspectives, focusing on the sources and consequences of the extent to which men actually have characteristics culturally defined as masculine; and normative perspectives, deriving from the social constructionist view of gender roles, which concentrate on the nature and consequences of the standards by which cultures define masculinity. To illustrate the difference, a \"traditional\" male, in terms of gender-related personality traits, actually has culturally defined masculine characteristics. Using the normative perspective, this study examines the influence of masculinity ideology on adolescent males' behavior and attitudes in close heterosexual relationships. Masculinity ideology refers to beliefs about the importance of men adhering to culturally defined standards for male behavior, and the construct is operationalized by measures of attitudes toward the male gender role. The construct of masculinity ideology should be considered against the background of two earlier approaches to the male gender role.","author":[{"family":"Pleck","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Sonenstein","given":"Freya"},{"family":"Ku","given":"Leighton"}],"container-title":"Journal of Social Issues","ISSN":"0022-4537","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1993]]},"page":"19","title":"Masculinity ideology: its impact on adolescent males' heterosexual relationships.","type":"article-journal","volume":"49"},

  {"id":"proust2010","abstract":"Given disagreement about the architecture of the mind, the nature of self‐knowledge, and its epistemology, the question of how to understand the function and the scope of metacognition – the control of one’s cognition – is still a matter of hot debate. A dominant view, the self‐ascriptive view, has been that metacognition necessarily requires representing one’s own mental states as mental states, and, therefore, necessarily involves an ability to read one’s mind. The main claims of this view are articulated, and the difficulties that they raise are discussed. An alternative view of metacognition, the ‘self‐evaluative view’, is then examined. It is argued that this view provides an account of metacognition that is both empirically and conceptually more adequate than the self‐ascriptive model. Particular attention is given to the problem of transferring self‐evaluative judgments to the case of others.","author":[{"family":"Proust","given":"Joëlle"}],"container-title":"Philosophy Compass","DOI":"10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00340.x","ISSN":"1747-9991","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010]]},"page":"989–998","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Metacognition","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

In the present investigation, we examine factors that influence the decision to store information in-the-world versus in-the-head using a variant of a traditional short term memory task. In Experiments 1a and 1b participants were presented with to-be-remembered items and either had to rely solely on internal memory or had the option to write down the presented information. In Experiments 2a and 2b participants were presented with the same stimuli but made metacognitive judgments about their predicted performance and effort expenditure.

A framework for conducting community-based, empowerment research that draws on theories of community psychology, feminism, and postmodernism is presented. The study was designed to understand the dynamics of abusive lesbian relationships and social service providers' responses to the abuse. Results from 80 in-depth interviews with lesbians who have experienced relationship violence are examined with a particular focus on a pattern of first relationships being abusive and a theme of shifting power dynamics. Analysis of focus group discussions with 45 feminist service providers (e.g., counselors, shelter workers, social workers, healthcare providers) reveals the difficulties in assessing the power dynamics of abusive same-sex relationships and in developing appropriate responses when relying on heterosexually gendered models developed to address men's violence against women. The preliminary results present implications both for how we theorize and research this form of violence, and for improving the practices and policies of social services that work with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ristock","given":"Janice L."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Community Psychology","container-title-short":"Am J Community Psychol","DOI":"10.1023/A:1023971006882","ISSN":"1573-2770","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"329-341","source":"Springer Link","title":"Exploring dynamics of abusive lesbian relationships: preliminary analysis of a multisite, qualitative study","title-short":"Exploring dynamics of abusive lesbian relationships","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1023971006882","volume":"31"},

Given that spiteful behavior involves a voluntary setback of one's own goals, it is noteworthy that no research to date has examined the self-regulatory and motivational correlates of spitefulness. In this research, we show that spitefulness is positively related to prevention regulatory focus and trait impulsiveness, and negatively related to approach temperament, suggesting that spitefulness is generally motivated by spontaneous concerns about threat avoidance. In contrast, spitefulness was not predicted by promotion regulatory focus, avoidance temperament, dispositional locomotion, or dispositional assessment in our regression model.","author":[{"family":"Rodgers","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Dahling","given":"Jason"}],"container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","ISSN":"0191-8869","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"language":"eng","page":"257","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Self-regulatory correlates of spitefulness","type":"article-journal","volume":"123"},

Using this definition, we explored the impact of power on attentional processes involved in impression formation. Because powerful individuals may want to maintain and justify their position, powerful participants should pay particular attention to negative stereotype-consistent information about their subordinates. In contrast, powerless participants should devote their attention to stereotype-inconsistent information in an attempt to increase their control over the social context. Study 1 directly manipulated control by assigning participants to the role of leader or subordinate in a task group. Results showed that, compared to subordinates, leaders devoted more attention to negative stereotypic attributes. Study 2 manipulated the legitimacy of power and replicated the pattern found in Study 1 but only when power was illegitimate. Our findings suggest that the experience of power can be associated with feelings of threat, especially when power is illegitimate, thereby orienting impression-formation processes toward information likely to maintain the existing social structure.

  {"id":"rodriguez-nieto2019","abstract":"Sexual behavior is the open manifestation of a complex interplay between psychophysiological mechanisms that either facilitate or inhibit sexual thoughts, desires, and associated behaviors. Whereas sexual excitation has been widely studied, less is known about the impact of inhibitory control mechanisms that enable individuals to refrain from sexual cognition and behavior. The present study examined: (1) the relationship between general and sexual inhibitory mechanisms (as measured through self-reports and computer-based tasks), (2) the relation between sexual inhibitory processes at cognitive and motor-motivational levels and with sexual inhibition as an individual trait, and (3) the predictive value of these parameters on sexual thoughts (cognition) and behavior. We demonstrate that general inhibitory control (i.e., the ability to suppress any preponderant response) and the specific inhibition of sexual responses represent distinct processes that require at least partly different control mechanisms. Similarly, the ability to inhibit sexual visual input and the ability to suppress sexually driven responses seem to be two independent processes. The different inhibitory processes distinctively predicted the frequency of sexual thoughts and sexual behavior. We propose that these different inhibitory mechanisms are at play during different phases of sexual regulation (before and after the generation and unfolding of sexual arousal) and that a specific deficit in one of these processes may underlie the distinctive symptomatology and comorbidity of sexual disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodriguez-Nieto","given":"Geraldine"},{"family":"Emmerling","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Dewitte","given":"Marieke"},{"family":"Sack","given":"Alexander T."},{"family":"Schuhmann","given":"Teresa"}],"container-title":"Archives of Sexual Behavior","container-title-short":"Arch Sex Behav","DOI":"10.1007/s10508-018-1283-7","ISSN":"1573-2800","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"481-494","source":"Springer Link","title":"The role of inhibitory control mechanisms in the regulation of sexual behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-018-1283-7","volume":"48"},

We administered the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, the Spitefulness Scale, and the Impulsive Behavior Scale Short Form to a sample of individuals convicted of violent offenses ( n = 182) and a sample of community participants ( n = 203). Hierarchical regression analysis of the convicted sample showed that spitefulness predicted AQ scores positively and significantly beyond the roles of both pathological narcissism and impulsivity. Finally, mediation analyses showed that impulsivity partially mediated the relationships between aggression and both grandiose narcissism and spitefulness. Our results support the hypothesis that spitefulness plays an important role in the prediction of aggressiveness. Finally, impulsivity seems to be a central common variable that explains the relationship between pathological personality traits and aggressive behavior among individuals convicted of violent offenses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rogier","given":"Guyonne"},{"family":"Marzo","given":"Alessia"},{"family":"Velotti","given":"Patrizia"}],"container-title":"Criminal Justice and Behavior","container-title-short":"Criminal Justice and Behavior","DOI":"10.1177/0093854819862013","ISSN":"0093-8548, 1552-3594","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1475-1492","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Aggression among offenders: the complex interplay by grandiose narcissism, spitefulness, and impulsivity","title-short":"Aggression among offenders","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0093854819862013","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"rolison2019","abstract":"Research within the psychological risk-return framework, namely using the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale, has led to a conclusion that risk attitude—measured as an individual’s sensitivity to the risk they perceive—is stable across people (e.g., gender) and domains (e.g., recreational, social, financial, health). Risk-taking differences across gen-der and domain have been interpreted in terms of differences in the magnitude of risk per-ceived (and expected benefit). Yet, the DOSPERT scale items, contrived by researchers, ra-ther than decision-makers themselves, may have failed to detect differences in perceived risk attitude by failing to adequately represent all combinations of risks and benefits across gender and domains. In Study 1, participants generated their own examples of activities, which we selected among in Studies 2 and 3 to construct a new scale representing various levels of per-ceived risk and expected benefit. Our findings reveal that women are more sensitive than men to risk they perceive (i.e., are less tolerant of risk) in the recreational, social, and financial do-mains, but not the health domain. Risk attitude also differed across domains, with partici-pants tolerating more risk in some domains than in others. We conclude that gender and do-main differences in risk-taking stem partly from gender and domain differences in people’s sensitivity to perceived risks. Our findings have theoretical implications for the psychological risk-return framework and bridge with other theoretical approaches, such as the expected util-ity framework. Our studies also provide a new scale for assessing differences in attitudes to-ward risk that overcomes shortcomings of existing scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rolison","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Shenton","given":"Jeordie"}],"container-title":"Journal of Behavioral Decision Making","ISSN":"0894-3257","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,22]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Wiley","source":"repository.essex.ac.uk","title":"How much risk can you stomach?

In one member of the pair, the harm was a direct result of the action. In the other member, it was an indirect byproduct. Subjects preferred the indirect harm to the direct harm. This result could not be fully explained in terms of differences in judgments about which option was more active, more intentional, more likely to cause harm, or more subject to the disapproval of others. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a new bias in judgment, a tendency to favor indirectly harmful options over directly harmful alternatives, irrespective of the associated outcomes, intentions, or self-presentational concerns. We speculate that this bias could originate from the use of a typical but somewhat unreliable property of harmful acts, their directness, as a cue to moral evaluation. We discuss the implications of the bias for a range of social issues, including the distinction between passive and active euthanasia, legal deterrence, and the rhetoric of affirmative action. © 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","author":[{"family":"Royzman","given":"Edward B"},{"family":"Baron","given":"Jonathan"}],"container-title":"Social Justice Research","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002]]},"language":"en","page":"20","source":"Zotero","title":"The preference for indirect harm","type":"article-journal"},

Although a body of research on the cognitive elements of climate change has begun to accumulate (e.g., Bord, O'Connor, & Fisher, 2000, few studies have distinguished between categories of cognitions. One key distinction is between primary, direct thoughts such as perceptions and evaluations, and secondary, indirect thoughts which reflect upon and control primary cognitions (Petty, Brinol, Tormala, & Wegner, 2007); secondary thoughts are thus considered metacognitive. This distinction is important to climate change engagement given that primary and secondary thoughts may exert independent effects on behavior. Three metacognitive elements of climate change are delineated: metacognitive knowledge, or assessments of confidence in one's thoughts; metacognitive certainty, or assessments of the likelihood of an outcome; and metacognitive importance, or the relative emphasis placed on one's thoughts. The relations between these dimensions and climate change-relevant behaviors are explored.

However, the fact that participants report feelings of disgust when thinking about feces and a heinous crime does not necessarily indicate that the same mechanisms mediate these reactions. Humans might instead have separate neural and physiological systems guiding aversive behaviors and judgments across different domains. The present interdisciplinary study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 50) and behavioral assessment to investigate the biological homology of pathogen-related and moral disgust. We provide evidence that pathogen-related and sociomoral acts entrain many common as well as unique brain networks. We also investigated whether morality itself is composed of distinct neural and behavioral subdomains. We provide evidence that, despite their tendency to elicit similar ratings of moral wrongness, incestuous and nonsexual immoral acts entrain dramatically separate, while still overlapping, brain networks. These results (i) provide support for the view that the biological response of disgust is intimately tied to immorality, (ii) demonstrate that there are at least three separate domains of disgust, and (iii) suggest strongly that morality, like disgust, is not a unified psychological or neurological phenomenon.","author":[{"family":"Schaich Borg","given":"Jana"},{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Kiehl","given":"Kent A."}],"container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Cogn Neurosci","DOI":"10.1162/jocn.2008.20109","ISSN":"0898-929X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"1529-1546","PMCID":"PMC3969035","PMID":"18345982","source":"PubMed","title":"Infection, incest, and iniquity: investigating the neural correlates of disgust and morality","title-short":"Infection, incest, and iniquity","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"schmitt2017","abstract":"Previous studies have documented links between sub-clinical narcissism and the active pursuit of short-term mating strategies (e.g., unrestricted sociosexuality, marital infidelity, mate poaching). Nearly all of these investigations have relied solely on samples from Western cultures. In the current study, responses from a cross-cultural survey of 30,470 people across 53 nations spanning 11 world regions (North America, Central/South America, Northern Europe, Western Europe, Eastern\nEurope, Southern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Oceania, Southeast Asia, and East Asia) were used to evaluate whether narcissism (as measured by the Narcissistic Personality Inventory; NPI) was universally associated with short-term mating. Results revealed narcissism scores (including two broad factors and seven traditional facets as measured by the NPI) were functionally equivalent across cultures, reliably associating with key sexual outcomes (e.g., more active pursuit of short-term mating, intimate partner violence, and sexual aggression) and sex-related personality traits (e.g., higher extraversion and openness to experience). Whereas some features of personality (e.g., subjective well-being) were universally associated with socially adaptive facets of\nNarcissism (e.g., self-sufficiency), most indicators of short-term mating (e.g., unrestricted sociosexuality and marital infidelity) were universally associated with the socially maladaptive facets of narcissism (e.g., exploitativeness).

Los resultados sugieren que el narcisismo (incluidos muchos aspectos suyos medidos por el NPI) tiene las mismas asociaciones básicas con los rasgos de personalidad relacionados con el sexo (p. ej. extraversión alta) y con los resultados sexuales claves (p. ej. búsqueda más activa de las estrategias del emparejamiento a corto plazo) a través de las 11 mayores regiones mundiales del PDSI 2.

  {"id":"schnall2008","abstract":"Theories of moral judgment have long emphasized reasoning and conscious thought while downplaying the role of intuitive and contextual inﬂuences. However, recent research has demonstrated that incidental feelings of disgust can inﬂuence moral judgments and make them more severe. This study involved two experiments demonstrating that the reverse effect can occur when the notion of physical purity is made salient, thus making moral judgments less severe. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The ﬁndings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes, rather than deliberate reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection to moral purity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Schnall","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Benton","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Sophie"}],"container-title":"Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02227.x","ISSN":"0956-7976, 1467-9280","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1219-1222","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"With a clean conscience: cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments","title-short":"With a clean conscience","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02227.x","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"schrift2011","abstract":"A great deal of research in consumer decision-making and social-cognition has explored consumers’ attempts to simplify choices by bolstering their tentative choice candidate and/or denigrating the other alternatives. The present research investigates a diametrically opposed process, whereby consumers complicate their decisions. The authors demonstrate that, in order to complicate their choices, consumers increase choice conflict by over-weighing small disadvantages of superior alternatives, converging overall evaluations of alternatives, reversing the ordinal value of attributes, and even choosing less preferred alternatives. Further, the results from five studies support a unifying theoretical framework, namely the effort-compatibility principle. Specifically, it is argued that consumers strive for compatibility between the effort they anticipate and the effort that they actually exert. When a certain decision seems more difficult than initially expected, a simplifying process ensues. However, when the decision feels easier to resolve than was anticipated (e.g., when consumers face an important, yet easy choice), consumers artificially increase their effort.","author":[{"family":"Schrift","given":"R.

  {"id":"schwartz2013","abstract":"In this chapter, we take the position that self-regulation and metacognition reveal an undeniable conceptual core that assumes individuals make efforts to monitor their thoughts and actions, and try to gain some control over them. In the neurosciences, the higher-order processes of monitoring and control are referred to as “executive control processes”—processes that should be evident as neurological activity within known neuroanatomical locations. From this vantage point, we closely examine two predominant cognitive models of working memory—Cowan’s embedded processing model and Baddeley’s model containing a central executive component. We conclude that the former is the best ﬁt with research from neuroscience and explains most efﬁciently the ﬁndings of metacognition in instruction. Thus, we offer a model of monitoring and control as a reciprocal function of the same neurologic processes that excite and inhibit, in a recursive fashion, the regions of the brain responsible for two types of activities involved in learning—the activities involved in processing the information itself relative to the goals of a task and the activities involved in processing (evaluating and correcting) the original activities deployed to seek goal attainment, activities that are metacognitive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Neil H."},{"family":"Scott","given":"Brianna M."},{"family":"Holzberger","given":"Doris"}],"container-title":"International Handbook of Metacognition and Learning Technologies","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_6","editor":[{"family":"Azevedo","given":"Roger"},{"family":"Aleven","given":"Vincent"}],"event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-4419-5545-6 978-1-4419-5546-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"language":"en","page":"79-94","publisher":"Springer New York","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metacognition: A closed-loop model of biased Competition–Evidence from neuroscience, cognition, and instructional research","title-short":"Metacognition","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4419-5546-3_6","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"shakeel2019","abstract":"BACKGROUNDMetacognition refers to the ability to evaluate and control our cognitive processes. While studies have investigated metacognition in schizophrenia and clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR), less is known about the potential mechanisms which result in metacognitive deficits. AIMSWe aimed to investigate whether neurocognitive functions including attention, working memory, verbal learning and executive functions predicted the tendency to focus on one's thoughts (cognitive self-consciousness) and beliefs in the efficacy of one's cognitive skills (cognitive confidence). METHODParticipants (130 CHR individuals) were recruited as part of the multi-site PREDICT study. They were assessed using the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ) as well as measures of executive function (WCST), attention (N-Back), working memory (LNS) and verbal learning (AVLT). RESULTSCognitive competence was negatively correlated with N-Back while cognitive self-consciousness was positively correlated with N-Back and LNS. Linear regression analysis with N-Back, AVLT, LNS and WCST as predictors showed that neurocognition significantly predicted cognitive self-consciousness, with N-Back, LNS and WCST as significant predictors. The model accounted for 14% of the variance in cognitive self-consciousness. However, neurocognition did not result in a significant predictive model of cognitive competence. CONCLUSIONSNeurocognition was associated with an increased focus on one's thoughts, but it was not associated with higher confidence in one's cognitive skills. Neurocognition accounted for less than one-sixth of the variance in metacognition, suggesting that interventions that target neurocognition are unlikely to improve metacognitive abilities.","author":[{"family":"Shakeel","given":"M.

  {"id":"spada2008","abstract":"The metacognitions questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30) by Wells and Cartwright-Hatton (2004) represents a unique measure of individual differences in metacognitive beliefs, judgements and monitoring tendencies considered to be crucial in the metacognitive theory (Wells, 2000) of psychological disturbances. However, the psychometric properties of this measure have not yet been exhaustively investigated. In this study we assessed 1304 participants from the general population. The relative independence of the five factors constituting the MCQ-30 was confirmed and reliability was satisfactory. A sub-sample of 399 participants was also investigated to verify whether previously observed associations between dimensions of metacognition and emotional distress (anxiety and depression) could be replicated. Structural equation modeling revealed that dimensions of metacognition contributed to both anxiety and depression providing further support for the validity of the measure. These findings, taken together, confirm that the MCQ-30 is a valuable tool for the assessment of metacognition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Spada","given":"Marcantonio M."},{"family":"Mohiyeddini","given":"Changiz"},{"family":"Wells","given":"Adrian"}],"container-title":"Personality and Individual Differences","container-title-short":"Personality and Individual Differences","DOI":"10.1016/j.paid.2008.04.005","ISSN":"0191-8869","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"238-242","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Measuring metacognitions associated with emotional distress: factor structure and predictive validity of the metacognitions questionnaire 30","title-short":"Measuring metacognitions associated with emotional distress","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886908001244","volume":"45"},

  {"id":"steinbeis2013","abstract":"Social comparison can elicit emotions such as envy, which can affect social interactions. The emergence and development of such social emotions through ontogeny, and their influence on social interaction, are unknown. We tested 182 children from 7 to 13years of age with a novel monetary reward-and-punishment task measuring envy and Schadenfreude (i.e., gloating or taking delight in someone else’s misfortune). Children were either rewarded or punished in a trial-by-trial evaluation of their performance on a speeded reaction time task. In a social condition, feedback of their own and a competitor’s performance was given for each trial. Afterward, children rated how they felt about the outcome. The ratings suggest that when children won, they felt better if the competitor lost instead of winning (i.e., Schadenfreude). Conversely, when children lost, they felt worse if the competitor won instead of losing (i.e., envy). Crucially, levels of envy and Schadenfreude decreased with age. We also studied how these emotions relate to social decisions made separately during three resource allocation paradigms. In each, children chose between two options that differed in the distribution of valuable tokens between themselves and an anonymous other. The combination of choices allowed the measurement of inequity aversion (i.e., equality for all) and spite (i.e., self-profit to maximal disadvantage of the other). We found an age-related increase in inequity aversion and decrease in spite. Crucially, age-related changes in both envy and Schadenfreude predicted the developmental change in equity-related decisions. These findings shed light on the development of social emotions and demonstrate their importance in the development of prosocial behavior in children.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Steinbeis","given":"Nikolaus"},{"family":"Singer","given":"Tania"}],"container-title":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Experimental Child Psychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jecp.2012.11.009","ISSN":"0022-0965","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"198-209","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The effects of social comparison on social emotions and behavior during childhood: the ontogeny of envy and schadenfreude predicts developmental changes in equity-related decisions","title-short":"The effects of social comparison on social emotions and behavior during childhood","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002209651200224X","volume":"115"},

Moreover, recent expansions of the PSDM suggest that the model applies to all forms of perfectionism. The present research challenges this suggestion. Three university student samples (Ns=318, 417, and 398) completed measures of self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism together with measures of trust, empathy, and hostility including aggression, anger, and spitefulness. In line with previous studies examining unique relationships of the three forms of perfectionism, only other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism showed a consistent pattern of unique relationships indicative of social disconnection and hostility. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism showed unique relationships indicative of social connection (and low hostility regarding physical aggression and spitefulness). The present findings indicate that the PSDM may not apply to all forms of perfectionism. Not all perfectionists feel socially disconnected and hostile towards others. Self-oriented perfectionists may feel socially connected and show no higher hostility than non-perfectionists, particularly when they are low in other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Stoeber","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Noland","given":"Andrew B."},{"family":"Mawenu","given":"Theresia W.

  {"id":"suessenbach2019","abstract":"The power motive predicts influential social behaviour; however, its heterogeneous conceptualisations have produced inconsistent results. To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6).

  {"id":"suter2011","abstract":"Do moral judgments hinge on the time available to render them? According to a recent dual-process model of moral judgment, moral dilemmas that engage emotional processes are likely to result in fast deontological gut reactions. In contrast, consequentialist responses that tot up lives saved and lost in response to such dilemmas would require cognitive control to override the initial response. Cognitive control, however, takes time. In two experiments, we manipulated the time available to arrive at moral judgments in two ways: by allotting a ﬁxed short or large amount of time, and by nudging people to answer swiftly or to deliberate thoroughly. We found that faster responses indeed lead to more deontological responses among those moral dilemmas in which the killing of one to save many necessitates manhandling an innocent person and in which this action is depicted as a means to an end. Thus, our results are the ﬁrst demonstration that inhibiting cognitive control through manipulations of time alters moral judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Suter","given":"Renata S."},{"family":"Hertwig","given":"Ralph"}],"container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2011.01.018","ISSN":"00100277","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,6]]},"language":"en","page":"454-458","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Time and moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010027711000448","volume":"119"},

We review current thinking on the distinction between shame and guilt, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two moral emotions. Several new areas of research are highlighted: research on the domain-specific phenomenon of body shame, styles of coping with shame, psychobiological aspects of shame, the link between childhood abuse and later proneness to shame, and the phenomena of vicarious or “collective” experiences of shame and guilt. In recent years, the concept of moral emotions has been expanded to include several positive emotions—elevation, gratitude, and the sometimes morally relevant experience of pride.

Across studies, SPMS was unrelated to trust in others and to trustworthiness, as measured by the trust game, and unrelated to fairness, as measured by the dictator game.

We also examined the psychometric structure of each measure using Rasch model item analysis (Rasch, 1966).\nMETHOD: Two equivalent cohorts of entering freshman males (N = 994 and N = 1043) from a large northeastern university completed online measures at the end of their first semester.\nRESULTS: Identical proportions of men reported using intoxication strategies (3%) and physical force (1%) during the past semester on both measures. However, more men reported verbal strategies on the SSS (7.8%) compared with the SES (3.7%), even when restricting to equivalent items. Rasch analysis suggested that the SSS conformed better to a unidimensional continuum of perpetration severity than the SES; however, Rasch analysis did not provide definitive support for either a tactic - based (SSS) nor a tactic plus outcome- based (SES) hierarchy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both measures functioned adequately. However, the SSS may be preferred for its better Rasch properties, better assessment of the less severe tactics, and simpler wording.","author":[{"family":"Testa","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Joseph H."},{"family":"Lucke","given":"Joseph F."},{"family":"Pagnan","given":"Colleen E."}],"container-title":"Psychology of Violence","container-title-short":"Psychol Violence","DOI":"10.1037/a0037584","ISSN":"2152-0828","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"285-293","PMCID":"PMC4564114","PMID":"26366321","source":"PubMed","title":"Measuring sexual aggression perpetration in college men: A comparison of two measures","title-short":"Measuring sexual aggression perpetration in college men","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"tinghog2016","abstract":"Do individuals intuitively favor certain moral actions over others? This study explores the role of intuitive thinking—induced by time pressure and cognitive load—in moral judgment and behavior. We conduct experiments in three different countries (Sweden, Austria, and the United States) involving over 1,400 subjects. All subjects responded to four trolley type dilemmas and four dictator games involving different charitable causes. Decisions were made under time pressure/time delay or while experiencing cognitive load or control. Overall we find converging evidence that intuitive states do not influence moral decisions. Neither time-pressure nor cognitive load had any effect on moral judgments or altruistic behavior. Thus we find no supporting evidence for the claim that intuitive moral judgments and dictator game giving differ from more reflectively taken decisions. Across all samples and decision tasks men were more likely to make utilitarian moral judgments and act selfishly compared to women, providing further evidence that there are robust gender differences in moral decision-making. However, there were no significant interactions between gender and the treatment manipulations of intuitive versus reflective decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tinghög","given":"Gustav"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"David"},{"family":"Bonn","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Johannesson","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Kirchler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Koppel","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Västfjäll","given":"Daniel"}],"container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0164012","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,26]]},"PMCID":"PMC5082681","PMID":"27783704","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Intuition and moral decision-making – the effect of time pressure and cognitive load on moral judgment and altruistic behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082681/","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"tjosvold1985","abstract":"Power differences are thought to interfere with superiors' interaction with subordinates. However, it is also argued that superiors with considerable power are most supportive of their subordinates. To explore these opposing positions, 90 undergraduates became managers with either high or low power who believed their goals were cooperatively, individualistically, or competitively related to their subordinate. Results support the hypothesis that social context affects how superiors use their power to interact with subordinates. High- and low-power superiors in cooperation had positive expectations, interacted constructively, restated the task, responded to requests for assistance, and developed a positive relationship compared to high- and low-power superiors in individualistic and competitive situations. In addition, only the high-power superiors in cooperation used their expertise to give direct aid to the subordinate. Results indicate that in cooperation superiors are likely to use their power constructively; however, in competitive and individualistic contexts, superiors are apt to fail to use their resources to facilitate subordinate performance. Results were also interpreted as suggesting that it is not so much the extent of superiors' power but the social context that affects their use of power and interaction with subordinates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Tjosvold","given":"Dean"}],"container-title":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","container-title-short":"Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes","DOI":"10.1016/0749-5978(85)90025-1","ISSN":"0749-5978","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[1985,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"281-293","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Power and social context in superior-subordinate interaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0749597885900251","volume":"35"},

Nonetheless, there is a lack of multi-countries studies exploring the relationship between timing of FSI and subsequent number of sexual partnerships. Our aim in this paper was to aggregate evidence from 34 sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the association between age at FSI and lifetime number of sexual partners, using Demographic and Health Survey data. Descriptive and multilevel mixed effects Poisson regression techniques were applied to the data. The findings reveal a significant association between age at FSI and subsequent number of lifetime sexual partners. This association remained post adjusting for education, wealth, marital status and residence for both men and women. Beyond these, the results showed that wealth worked in opposite direction in men and women—higher wealth status was protective for women while it exposed men to higher number of lifetime sexual partners. Higher education exposed both women and men to increased number of lifetime partnerships. We conclude that there is an association between delayed onset of sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners over time, regardless of gender and socio-demographic background. Sexual and reproductive health programmes calling for sexual partner reduction should focus more on age of sexual debut while factoring in the influence of the various socio-demographic dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuoyire","given":"Derek Anamaale"},{"family":"Anku","given":"Prince Justin"},{"family":"Alidu","given":"Laila"},{"family":"Amo-Adjei","given":"Joshua"}],"container-title":"Sexuality & Culture","container-title-short":"Sexuality & Culture","DOI":"10.1007/s12119-017-9488-9","ISSN":"1936-4822","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"651-668","source":"Springer Link","title":"Timing of first sexual intercourse and number of lifetime sexual partners in sub-saharan africa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-017-9488-9","volume":"22"},

Whereas traditional models have suggested that disgust serves to protect the self or neutralize reminders of our animal nature, an evolutionary perspective suggests that disgust functions to solve 3 qualitatively different adaptive problems related to pathogen avoidance, mate choice, and social interaction. The authors investigated this 3-domain model of disgust across 4 studies and examined how sensitivity to these functional domains relates to individual differences in other psychological constructs. Consistent with their predictions, factor analyses demonstrated that disgust sensitivity partitions into domains related to pathogens, sexuality, and morality. Further, sensitivity to the 3 domains showed predictable differentiation based on sex, perceived vulnerability to disease, psychopathic tendencies, and Big 5 personality traits. In exploring these 3 domains of disgust, the authors introduce a new measure of disgust sensitivity.

The field, however, still lacks a coherent theoretical framework for understanding the evolved function or functions of disgust. Here we present such a framework, emphasizing 2 levels of analysis: that of evolved function and that of information processing. Although there is widespread agreement that disgust evolved to motivate the avoidance of contact with disease-causing organisms, there is no consensus about the functions disgust serves when evoked by acts unrelated to pathogen avoidance. Here we suggest that in addition to motivating pathogen avoidance, disgust evolved to regulate decisions in the domains of mate choice and morality. For each proposed evolved function, we posit distinct information processing systems that integrate function-relevant information and account for the trade-offs required of each disgust system. By refocusing the discussion of disgust on computational mechanisms, we recast prior theorizing on disgust into a framework that can generate new lines of empirical and theoretical inquiry.","author":[{"family":"Tybur","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Kurzban","given":"Robert"},{"family":"DeScioli","given":"Peter"}],"container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1037/a0030778","ISSN":"1939-1471","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"65-84","PMID":"23205888","source":"PubMed","title":"Disgust: evolved function and structure","title-short":"Disgust","type":"article-journal","volume":"120"},
  {"id":"tybur2018","abstract":"People vary in the degree to which they experience disgust toward—and, consequently, avoid—cues to pathogens. Prodigious work has measured this variation and observed that it relates to, among other things, personality, psychopathological tendencies, and moral and political sentiments. Less work has sought to generate hypotheses aimed at explaining why this variation exists in the first place, and even less work has evaluated how well data support these hypotheses. In this paper, we present and review the evidence supporting three such proposals. First, researchers have suggested that variability reflects a general tendency to experience anxiety or emotional distress. Second, researchers have suggested that variability arises from parental modelling, with offspring calibrating their pathogen avoidance based on their parents' reactions to pathogen cues. Third, researchers have suggested that individuals calibrate their disgust sensitivity to the parasite stress of the ecology in which they develop. We conclude that none of these hypotheses is supported by existing data, and we propose directions for future research aimed at better understanding this variation., This article is part of the Theo Murphy meeting issue ‘Evolution of pathogen and parasite avoidance behaviours’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Tybur","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Çınar","given":"Çağla"},{"family":"Karinen","given":"Annika K."},{"family":"Perone","given":"Paola"}],"container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2017.0204","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1751","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,19]]},"PMCID":"PMC6000141","PMID":"29866917","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Why do people vary in disgust?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6000141/","volume":"373"},

However, a longstanding third perspective on morality, virtue ethics, may offer a richer descriptive account of a wide range of lay moral judgments. Building on this ethical tradition, we offer a person-centered account of moral judgment, which focuses on individuals as the unit of analysis for moral evaluations rather than on acts. Because social perceivers are fundamentally motivated to acquire information about the moral character of others, features of an act that seem most informative of character often hold more weight than either the consequences of the act or whether a moral rule has been broken. This approach, we argue, can account for numerous empirical findings that are either not predicted by current theories of moral psychology or are simply categorized as biases or irrational quirks in the way individuals make moral judgments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Uhlmann","given":"Eric Luis"},{"family":"Pizarro","given":"David A."},{"family":"Diermeier","given":"Daniel"}],"container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691614556679","ISSN":"1745-6916, 1745-6924","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1]]},"language":"en","page":"72-81","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A person-centered approach to moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614556679","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"vaccaro2018","abstract":"Metacognition supports reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes. Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human psychology, its neural substrates remain underdetermined, partly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive judgement under study. It is also unclear how metacognition relates to other apparently similar abilities that depend on recursive thought such as theory of mind or mentalising. Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different analysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood estimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related activation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of confidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We found preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due to fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to meta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition and mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaccaro","given":"Anthony G."},{"family":"Fleming","given":"Stephen M."}],"container-title":"Brain and Neuroscience Advances","container-title-short":"Brain Neurosci Adv","DOI":"10.1177/2398212818810591","ISSN":"2398-2128","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]]},"PMCID":"PMC6238228","PMID":"30542659","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Thinking about thinking: A coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of metacognitive judgements","title-short":"Thinking about thinking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238228/","volume":"2"},

In a world of risk (“small world”), all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are known. In uncertain (“large”) worlds, some of this information is unknown or unknowable. Most of cognitive neuroscience studies exclusively study the neural correlates for decisions under risk (e.g., lotteries), with the tacit implication that understanding these would lead to an understanding of decision making in general. First, we show that normative strategies for decisions under risk do not generalize to uncertain worlds, where simple heuristics are often the more accurate strategies. Second, we argue that the cognitive processes for making decisions in a world of risk are not the same as those for dealing with uncertainty. Because situations with known risks are the exception rather than the rule in human evolution, it is unlikely that our brains are adapted to them.

  {"id":"wagner2012","abstract":"Men who have sex with men (MSM) may account for most new HIV infections in Lebanon, yet little is known about the factors that influence sexual risk behavior and HIV testing in this population. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 31 MSM living in Beirut, and content analysis was used to identify emergent themes. Mean age of the participants was 28.4 years, and all identified as either gay (77%) or bisexual (23%). Half reported not using condoms consistently and one quarter had not been HIV-tested. Many described not using condoms with a regular partner in the context of a meaningful relationship, mutual HIV testing, and a desire to not use condoms, suggesting that trust, commitment and intimacy play a role in condom use decisions. Condoms were more likely to be used with casual partners, partners believed to be HIV-positive, and with partners met online where men found it easier to candidly discuss HIV risk. Fear of infection motivated many to get HIV tested and use condoms, but such affect also led some to avoid HIV testing in fear of disease and social stigma if found to be infected. Respondents who were very comfortable with their sexual orientation and who had disclosed their sexuality to family and parents tended to be more likely to use condoms consistently and be tested for HIV. These findings indicate that similar factors influence the condom use and HIV testing of MSM in Beirut as those observed in studies elsewhere of MSM; hence, prevention efforts in Lebanon can likely benefit from lessons learned and interventions developed in other regions, particularly for younger, gay-identified men. Further research is needed to determine how prevention efforts may need to be tailored to address the needs of men who are less integrated into or do not identify with the gay community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Wagner","given":"Glenn J."},{"family":"Aunon","given":"Frances M."},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Rachel L."},{"family":"Rana","given":"Yashodhara"},{"family":"Khouri","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Tohme","given":"Johnny"},{"family":"Mokhbat","given":"Jacques"}],"container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0045566","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,18]]},"PMCID":"PMC3445492","PMID":"23029103","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A qualitative exploration of sexual risk and HIV testing behaviors among men who have sex with men in beirut, lebanon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3445492/","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"wakschlag2005","abstract":"This paper presents the clinical/developmental framework underlying a new diagnostic observational tool, the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS). The special importance of observation for clinical assessment during the preschool period is delineated. The developmental rationale for a multi-dimensional assessment of disruptive behavior in young children, including problems in modulation of negative affect and low competence is discussed. The ways in which the DB-DOS will elucidate distinctions between normative and atypical behavior during this developmental period via (a) the integration of qualitative and quantitative dimensions of behavior within a clinically-sensitive coding system, (b) the observation of child behavior both within, and outside of, the parent–child context and (c) the use of specially designed tasks to “press” for clinically salient behaviors are addressed. The promise of this new method for yielding a more precise, developmentally based description of the phenotype of early onset disruptive behavior problems and for providing a standardized clinical tool for observational assessment of disruptive behavior in young children is presented. Large-scale validation of the measure is currently underway.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wakschlag","given":"Lauren S."},{"family":"Leventhal","given":"Bennett L."},{"family":"Briggs-Gowan","given":"Margaret J."},{"family":"Danis","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Keenan","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Carri"},{"family":"Egger","given":"Helen L."},{"family":"Cicchetti","given":"Domenic"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Alice S."}],"container-title":"Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10567-005-6664-5","ISSN":"1573-2827","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"183-201","source":"Springer Link","title":"Defining the “disruptive” in preschool behavior: what diagnostic observation can teach us","title-short":"Defining the “disruptive” in preschool behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10567-005-6664-5","volume":"8"},

On the other hand, students and researchers of consumer behavior will be offered an advanced account of relevant theories tailored to their interests. While the range of topics is rather broad – including the construal of judgments and decisions, affective and cognitive feelings, social and media influences, and goals and self-regulation – each chapter is focused on one specific theoretical or methodological perspective and thereby gives a comprehensive and penetrative account of the relevant issues and the respective research.

  {"id":"weber2002","abstract":"We present a psychometric scale that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. Respondents rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities (Part I). An optional Part II assesses respondents' perceptions of the magnitude of the risks and expected benefits of the activities judged in Part I. The scale's construct validity and consistency is evaluated for a sample of American undergraduate students. As expected, respondents' degree of risk taking was highly domain-specific, i.e. not consistently risk-averse or consistently risk-seeking across all content domains. Women appeared to be more risk-averse in all domains except social risk. A regression of risk taking (likelihood of engaging in the risky activity) on expected benefits and perceived risks suggests that gender and content domain differences in apparent risk taking are associated with differences in the perception of the activities' benefits and risk, rather than with differences in attitude towards perceived risk.

However, our understanding of these beliefs and their relationship with symptoms in adolescents with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis is limited. Methods The Metacognitions Questionnaire short form (MCQ-30) was administered to 31 adolescents with an identified ARMS. Scores were subsequently compared to a control group of 76 adolescents drawn from a community population. Results As predicted, ARMS patients scored significantly higher on metacognition subscales, with negative beliefs (F = 42.97, P = 0.001), cognitive confidence (F = 17.11, P = 0.001) and need for control (F = 22.48, P = 0.001) subscales of the MCQ-30 distinguishing them from the comparison group.

In the truth and bias model, judgments about the world are pulled by 2 primary forces, the truth force and the bias force, and these 2 forces are interrelated. The truth and bias model differentiates force and value, where the force is the strength of the attraction and the value is the location toward which the judgment is attracted. The model also makes a formal theoretical distinction between bias and moderator variables. Two major classes of biases are discussed: biases that are measured with variables (e.g., assumed similarity) and directional bias, which refers to the extent to which judgments are pulled toward 1 end of the judgment continuum. Moderator variables are conceptualized as variables that affect the accuracy and bias forces but that do not affect judgments directly. We illustrate the model with 4 examples. We discuss the theoretical, empirical, methodological, measurement, and design implications of the model.","author":[{"family":"West","given":"Tessa V."},{"family":"Kenny","given":"David A."}],"container-title":"Psychological Review","container-title-short":"Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1037/a0022936","ISSN":"1939-1471","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,4]]},"language":"eng","page":"357-378","PMID":"21480740","source":"PubMed","title":"The truth and bias model of judgment","type":"article-journal","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"winter2016","abstract":"Power is a necessary dimension of all human enterprises. It can inspire and illuminate, but it can also corrupt, oppress, and destroy. Therefore, taming power has been a central moral and political question for most of human history. Writers, theorists, and researchers have suggested many methods and mechanisms for taming power: through affiliation and love, intellect and reason, responsibility, religion and values, democratic political structures, and separation of powers. Historical examples and social science research suggest that each has some success, but also that each is vulnerable to being hijacked by power itself. I therefore introduce generative historical consciousness (GHC) as a concept and measure that might help to secure the benefits of power while protecting against its outrages and excesses. I conclude by discussing the role that GHC may have played in the peaceful resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Winter","given":"David G."}],"container-title":"American Psychologist","container-title-short":"American Psychologist","DOI":"10.1037/a0039312","ISSN":"1935-990X, 0003-066X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"160-174","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Taming power: generative historical consciousness.","title-short":"Taming power","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0039312","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"witkower2020","abstract":"Converging evidence suggests that high rank is communicated through various nonverbal behaviors (e.g., expansiveness), but prior studies have not examined whether 2 distinct forms of high rank—known as prestige and dominance—are communicated through distinct nonverbal displays. Given the divergent messages that prestigious and dominant leaders need to send in order to attain and retain their place in the social hierarchy, theoretical accounts would suggest that individuals use distinct sets of nonverbal behaviors to communicate these 2 forms of high rank. In the present research, we tested this hypothesis in 7 studies, using carefully controlled experimental designs (Studies 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b) and the assessment of spontaneously displayed nonverbal behaviors that occurred during a lab-based group interaction (Study 5) and a real-world political contest (Study 6). Results converged across studies to show that prestige and dominance strategies are associated with distinct sets of nonverbal behaviors, which are largely consistent with theoretical predictions. Specifically, prestige, or the attainment of rank through earned respect, and dominance, or the use of intimidation and force to obtain power, are communicated from different head positions (i.e., tilted upward vs. downward), smiling behaviors (i.e., presence vs. absence of a symmetrical smile), and different forms of bodily expansion (i.e., subtle chest expansion vs. more grandiose space-taking). These findings provide the first evidence for 2 distinct signals of high rank, which spontaneously emerge in social interactions and guide social perceptions and the conferral of power.

The present study sought to examine the nature, frequency, and determinants of self-reported complaints of prospective memory (ProM) in HIV, which is a singly dissociable and ecologically relevant aspect of episodic memory involving the execution of future intentions. Seventy-five HIV seropositive individuals and 60 seronegative volunteers were administered the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PMRQ) as part of extensive neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical research assessments. The HIV sample endorsed more frequent ProM complaints in daily life than the seronegative group, particularly on items requiring self-initiated cue detection and retrieval. Within both study groups, ProM complaints were significantly more frequent than RetM complaints. Although the HIV sample was impaired relative to the seronegative group on an objective, performance-based ProM test, selfreported ProM complaints did not correspond to actual ProM abilities. However, greater frequency of self-reported ProM complaints was moderately associated with increased fatigue, as well as with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Consistent with prior research on RetM in HIV, results indicate that affective distress contributes to a metamemory deficit for HIV-associated ProM impairment, which highlights the potential importance of assessing both self-reported and performance-based ProM in clinical and research neuroAIDS evaluations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Woods","given":"S"},{"family":"Carey","given":"C"},{"family":"Moran","given":"L"},{"family":"Dawson","given":"M"},{"family":"Letendre","given":"S"},{"family":"Grant","given":"I"}],"container-title":"Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology","container-title-short":"Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology","DOI":"10.1016/j.acn.2006.12.006","ISSN":"08876177","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,2]]},"language":"en","page":"187-195","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Frequency and predictors of self-reported prospective memory complaints in individuals infected with HIV","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/acn/article-lookup/doi/10.1016/j.acn.2006.12.006","volume":"22"},

We investigated whether experiencing powerlessness induces the experience of self-dehumanization using three methods: priming, role-playing, and cueing. People in a position of low power viewed themselves (Experiments 1–3) as less human relative to people in a position of high power; furthermore, people with low power believed that they were viewed as less human by others as well (Experiments 2–3). In all of the experiments, human nature traits were most negatively affected by powerlessness in self-perception judgments, and uniquely human traits were most negatively affected by powerlessness in meta-perception judgments. Furthermore, the powerless believed they were viewed as less human not only by the powerful people but also the outside observers of the power dynamic. Self-dehumanization also appears to be a consequence of powerlessness rather than an incidental result of a change in mood or a negative self-view. Our findings are an important extension of previous work on the adverse effects of powerlessness and dehumanization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Wenqi"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Shenghua"},{"family":"He","given":"Surina"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yijie"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0125721","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,5,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0125721","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The impact of power on humanity: self-dehumanization in powerlessness","title-short":"The impact of power on humanity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0125721","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"yeung2012","abstract":"People are capable of robust evaluations of their decisions: they are often aware of their mistakes even without explicit feedback, and report levels of confidence in their decisions that correlate with objective performance. These metacognitive abilities help people to avoid making the same mistakes twice, and to avoid overcommitting time or resources to decisions that are based on unreliable evidence. In this review, we consider progress in characterizing the neural and mechanistic basis of these related aspects of metacognition—confidence judgements and error monitoring—and identify crucial points of convergence between methods and theories in the two fields. This convergence suggests that common principles govern metacognitive judgements of confidence and accuracy; in particular, a shared reliance on post-decisional processing within the systems responsible for the initial decision. However, research in both fields has focused rather narrowly on simple, discrete decisions—reflecting the correspondingly restricted focus of current models of the decision process itself—raising doubts about the degree to which discovered principles will scale up to explain metacognitive evaluation of real-world decisions and actions that are fluid, temporally extended, and embedded in the broader context of evolving behavioural goals.","author":[{"family":"Yeung","given":"N."},{"family":"Summerfield","given":"C."}],"container-title":"Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society B-Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2011.0416","ISSN":"0962-8436","issue":"1594","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"English","page":"1310–1321","source":"discovered.ed.ac.uk","title":"Metacognition in human decision-making: confidence and error monitoring","title-short":"Metacognition in human decision-making","type":"article-journal","volume":"367"},

The present study takes a cognitive neuroscience approach to investigating how information about an agent's beliefs and an action's consequences contribute to moral judgment. We build on prior developmental evidence showing that these factors contribute differentially to the young child's moral judgments coupled with neurobiological evidence suggesting a role for the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ) in belief attribution. Participants read vignettes in a 2 × 2 design: protagonists produced either a negative or neutral outcome based on the belief that they were causing the negative outcome (“negative” belief) or the neutral outcome (“neutral” belief). The RTPJ showed significant activation above baseline for all four conditions but was modulated by an interaction between belief and outcome. Specifically, the RTPJ response was highest for cases of attempted harm, where protagonists were condemned for actions that they believed would cause harm to others, even though the harm did not occur. The results not only suggest a general role for belief attribution during moral judgment, but also add detail to our understanding of the interaction between these processes at both the neural and behavioral levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Young","given":"Liane"},{"family":"Cushman","given":"Fiery"},{"family":"Hauser","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Saxe","given":"Rebecca"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0701408104","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"8235-8240","PMID":"17485679","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The neural basis of the interaction between theory of mind and moral judgment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/104/20/8235","volume":"104"},

Furthermore, we showed that physical cleansing alleviates the upsetting consequences of unethical behavior and reduces threats to one's moral self-image.

  {"id":"zurbriggen2011","abstract":"This study was designed to provide an assessment of the relationship between the two most important implicit motives and the most frequently studied sexual behaviors. A community sample of 102 men and 92 women completed measures of implicit power and afﬁliation-intimacy motives, sexual conservatism, social desirability, and sexual behavior. For men, high power motivation was positively associated with the number of sexual partners and the frequency of sex. There was an interaction between sexual conservatism and power motivation in women. For women low in sexual conservatism, high power motivation was positively associated with the number of sexual partners and with earlier initiation to intercourse and oral sex. There were few associations between afﬁliation-intimacy motivation and sexual behaviors; however, women high in this motive reported later initiation to oral sex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurbriggen","given":"Eileen L."}],"container-title":"The Journal of Social Psychology","container-title-short":"The Journal of Social Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/00224540903365372","ISSN":"0022-4545, 1940-1183","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,9]]},"language":"en","page":"535-555","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Implicit motives and sexual conservatism as predictors of sexual behaviors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224540903365372","volume":"151"}
